Vasculature not only provides an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients but also removes waste products or gas exchange. The process of angiogenesis is controlled by various transcriptional factors and growth factors. It has been observed that the discovery of angiogenic inhibitors can help to reduce carcinomas growth. Presently, chemotherapeutic drugs mediated inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), which initiates neovascularization under hypoxic conditions in the tumor, is being investigated. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and receptor VEGFR mediated activation of endothelial cells are also inhibited by chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, chemotherapeutic drugs inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways mediated growth of new blood vessels. The aim of this chapter would be to highlight the role of angiogenesis in cancer progression. Furthermore, various anti-cancer therapeutic strategies/trials based upon inhibition of blood vessels would also be discussed.","2020","2025-07-24 20:26:36","2025-07-24 20:26:36","2024-09-19","165–183","","","","","","Angiogenesis","","","","","Springer","Singapore","en","","","","","","","Citation Key: Atale2020 DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-7586-0_9","","","","Anti-angiogenesis drugs; Endothelial cell; Hypoxia-inducible factor; Tumor angiogenesis; Vascular endothelial growth factor","","Tuli, Hardeep Singh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial-cell migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumors. In this paper we present both continuous and discrete mathematical models which describe the formation of the capillary sprout network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take into account essential endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule fibronectin. The continuous model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the initial migratory response of endothelial cells to the TAF and the fibronectin. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and compared qualitatively with in vivo experiments. We then use a discretized form of the partial differential equations to develop a biased random-walk model which enables us to track individual endothelial cells at the sprout tips and incorporate anastomosis, mitosis and branching explicitly into the model. The theoretical capillary networks generated by computer simulations of the discrete model are compared with the morphology of capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments.","1998-09","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","","857–899","","5","60","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Citation Key: Anderson1998 PMID: 9739618","","","","Angiogenesis Inducing Agents; Animals; Arteriovenous Anastomosis; Biological; Capillaries; Cell Communication; Cell Division; Computer Simulation; Computer-Assisted; Endothelium; Experimental; Fibronectins; Humans; Mitosis; Models; Neoplasms; Neovascularization; Numerical Analysis; Pathologic; Stochastic Processes; Vascular","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It plays a key role in many biological processes, including embryonic development and wound healing, and contributes to many diseases including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The structure of the resulting vessel networks determines their ability to deliver nutrients and remove waste products from biological tissues. Here we simulate the Anderson-Chaplain model of angiogenesis at different parameter values and quantify the vessel architectures of the resulting synthetic data. Specifically, we propose a topological data analysis (TDA) pipeline for systematic analysis of the model. TDA is a vibrant and relatively new field of computational mathematics for studying the shape of data. We compute topological and standard descriptors of model simulations generated by different parameter values. We show that TDA of model simulation data stratifies parameter space into regions with similar vessel morphology. The methodologies proposed here are widely applicable to other synthetic and experimental data including wound healing, development, and plant biology., Vascular networks play a key role in many physiological processes, by delivering nutrition to, and removing waste from, biological tissues. In cancer, tumors stimulate the growth of new blood vessels, via a process called angiogenesis. The resulting vascular structure comprises many inter-connected vessels which lead to emergent morphologies that influence the rate of tumor growth and treatment efficacy. In this work, we consider several approaches to summarize the morphology of synthetic vascular networks generated from a mathematical model of tumor-induced angiogenesis. We find that a topological approach can be used quantify vascular morphology of model simulations and group the simulations into biologically interpretable clusters. This methodology may be useful for the diagnosis of abnormal blood vessel networks and quantifying the efficacy of vascular-targeting treatments.","2021-06","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2024-09-19","e1009094","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Nardini2021 PMID: 34181657 tex.pmcid: PMC8270459","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By focusing on a simple three-node motif, we predict that network “redundancy”, in the form of a redundant vessel connecting two main flow-branches, together with differences in haemodynamic resistance in the branches, can promote the emergence of oscillatory dynamics. We use existing mathematical descriptions for blood rheology and haematocrit splitting at vessel branch-points to construct our flow model; we combine numerical simulations and stability analysis to study the dynamics of the three-node network and its relation to the system's multiple steady-state solutions. While, for the case of equal inlet-pressure conditions, a “trivial” equilibrium solution with no flow in the redundant vessel always exists, we find that it is not stable when other, stable, steady-state attractors exist. In turn, these “nontrivial” steady-state solutions may undergo a Hopf bifurcation into an oscillatory state. We use the branch diameter ratio, together with the inlet haematocrit rate, to construct a two-parameter stability diagram that delineates regimes in which such oscillatory dynamics exist. We show that flow oscillations in this network geometry are only possible when the branch diameters are sufficiently different to allow for a sufficiently large flow in the redundant vessel, which acts as the driving force of the oscillations. These microstructural properties, which were found to promote oscillatory dynamics, could be used to explore sources of flow instability in biological microvascular networks.","2022-08","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-04-26","85","","8","84","","","","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: ben-amiStructuralFeaturesMicrovascular2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although mouse models and correlative patient data indicate that the lymphatic capillary density directly correlates with functional output, i.e., tissue fluid drainage and trafficking efficiency of dendritic cells, the mechanisms ensuring efficient tissue coverage remain poorly understood. Here, we use the mouse ear pinna lymphatic vessel network as a model system and combine lineage-tracing, genetic perturbations, whole-organ reconstructions and theoretical modeling to show that the dermal lymphatic capillaries tile space in an optimal, space-filling manner. This coverage is achieved by two complementary mechanisms: initial tissue invasion provides a non-optimal global scaffold via self-organized branching morphogenesis, while VEGF-C dependent side-branching from existing capillaries rapidly optimizes local coverage by directionally targeting low-density regions. With these two ingredients, we show that a minimal biophysical model can reproduce quantitatively whole-network reconstructions, across development and perturbations. Our results show that lymphatic capillary networks can exploit local self-organizing mechanisms to achieve tissue-scale optimization., The lymphatic system is a transport network that controls immune response and tissue fluid circulation in the body.

Radial distributions in blood viscosity, shear stress, and shear rate are obtained and used to predict axial pressure gradient, apparent viscosity, and endothelial-cell surface-layer thickness in vivo. Based solely on microparticle image velocimetry data, which are readily obtainable during the course of most intravital microscopy protocols from systemically injected particle tracers, we show that the microviscometric method consistently predicted a reduction in local and apparent blood viscosity after isovolemic hemodilution. Among its clinical applications, hemodilution is a procedure that is used to treat various pathologies that require reduction in peripheral vascular-flow resistance. Our results are directly relevant in this context because they suggest that the fractional decrease in systemic hematocrit is ≈25–35% greater than the accompanying fractional decrease in microvascular-flow resistance in vivo. In terms of its fundamental usefulness, the microviscometric method provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis of microvascular hemodynamics that has applications in broad areas of medicine and physiology and is particularly relevant to quantitative studies of angiogenesis, tumor growth, leukocyte adhesion, vascular-flow resistance, tissue perfusion, and endothelial-cell mechanotransduction.","2004-07","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-01","10060–10065","","27","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: longMicroviscometryRevealsReduced2004 Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vast number of blood vessels in the circulatory system, more than 109, implies that vessels’ arrangement and structure are not under individual genetic control but emerge as a result of generic responses of each segment to the various stimuli that it experiences. To obtain insight into the types of response that are needed, a network-oriented approach has been used, in which theoretical models are used to simulate structural adaptation in vascular networks, and the results are compared with experimental observations. With regard to the structural control of vessel diameters, this approach shows that responses to both haemodynamic and metabolic stimuli are needed for the formation of functionally adequate and efficient network structures. Furthermore, information transfer in both upstream and downstream directions is essential for balancing flows between long and short flow pathways. Otherwise, functional shunting occurs, that is, short pathways become enlarged and flow bypasses longer pathways. Information transfer in the upstream direction is achieved by conducted responses communicated along vessel walls. Simulations of structural adaptation in tumour microvascular networks indicate that impaired vascular communication, resulting in functional shunting, may be an important factor causing the dysfunctional microcirculation and local hypoxia typically observed in tumours. Anti-angiogenic treatment of tumours may restore vascular communication and thereby improve or normalize flow distribution in tumour vasculature.","2012","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2024-09-19","63–69","","1","110","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Citation Key: Secomb2012 tex.copyright: © 2011 The Authors.

A balance between the formation of new blood vessels, vascular remodeling, and vessel quiescence is fundamental for tissue growth and function. Whilst the major mechanisms contributing to the formation of new blood vessels have been well explored in recent years, vascular remodeling and quiescence remain poorly understood. In this review, we highlight the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for vessel remodeling and quiescence during angiogenesis.

One striking feature of vascular development is the interlacing of arteries and veins. How arteries and veins manage to avoid themselves and interlace with such a perfect architecture is not understood. Here we present a detailed view of the development of the vasculature in the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo. We find that the origin of arteriovenous interlacing lies in the presence of an increased hemodynamic resistance at the distal part of the arteries due to vascular flattening onto the ectodermal surface. This reduces the vascular conductance distally, thus repelling veins away. In more proximal parts, vessels round off into cylinders and the increased flow attracts veins.","2018-12","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2024-09-19","1–11","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Citation Key: Richard2018 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group tex.copyright: 2018 The Author(s)","","","","Angiogenesis; Cardiovascular biology; Time-lapse imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, general coarse grained models for flow networks with local positive feedback rules for the vessel conductivity typically get trapped in low efficiency, local minima.

As it explores its environment, it adapts and optimizes its network to external stimuli. It has been shown to exhibit complex behavior, like solving mazes, finding the shortest path, and creating cost-efficient and robust networks. Several models have been developed to attempt to mimic its network's adaptation in order to try to understand the mechanisms behind its behavior as well as to be able to create efficient networks. This thesis aims to study a recently developed, physically-consistent model based on adaptive Hagen-Poiseuille flows on graphs, determining the properties of the trees it creates and probing them to understand if they are realistic and consistent with experiment. It also intends to use said model to produce short and efficient networks, applying it to a real-life transport network example. We have found that the model is able to create networks that are consistent with biological networks: they follow Murray's law at steady state, exhibit structures similar to Physarum's networks, and even present peristalsis (oscillations of the vein radii) and shuttle streaming (the back-and-forth movement of cytoplasm inside Physarum's veins) in some parts of the networks. We have also used the model paired with different stochastic algorithms to produce efficient, short, and cost-efficient networks; when compared to a real transport network, mainland Portugal's railway system, all algorithms proved to be more efficient and some proved to be more cost-efficient.","2023-09","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2024-12-23","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 2023 DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2309.10577","","","","Physics - Fluid Dynamics","","","","","Valente, Ana Filipa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As it forages, Physarum dynamically rearranges its network structure as a response to local stimuli information, optimising the connection between food sources. This high-level behaviour was already exploited to solve numerous optimisation problems. We develop a flow-based model for the adaptive network formation of Physarum, which solves some inconsistencies of previous models. We first derive a general class of equations describing the adaptation and flow dynamics of a static network comprised of elastic channels filled with an incompressible fluid undergoing a Hagen-Poiseuille flow. An explicit form of the model is obtained by minimising the total power dissipated by the network. Considering a more general functional form of the adaptive equations, a phase transition in the system is also found. The model is used for maze-solving and to build efficient and resilient networks in an arena mimicking mainland Portugal. By comparing the resulting networks with the real Portuguese railway system, we found that the model produced networks with a better overall performance when considering fluctuations in the network flows. Finally, the adaption model is extended to incorporate the network growth in the presence of multiple food sources. The coupling of both processes produces networks with similar traits to several network systems found in nature. We found that when the food sources operate alternately, the model can replicate the direct connections between the food sources observed in Physarum.","2023-05","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2024-12-23","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 2023Almeida DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2305.12244","","","","Physics - Fluid Dynamics","","","","","Almeida, Rodrigo; Dilão, Rui","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a uniform nutrient distribution is critical, as it prevents tissue death in poorly supplied areas. How, then, do vascular networks achieve equi-perfusion? Given the extensive number of vessels in animal vascular systems, the structure of smaller vessels cannot be fully genetically predetermined and thus relies on a self-organizing developmental mechanism. We propose a simple, optimization-based adaptation rule to control vessel radii, aiming to equalize perfusion while minimizing flow resistance and material cost. This adaptation balances three competing factors: perfusion efficiency, energy dissipation, and material expenditure, which together drive complex network morphologies. These morphologies range from hierarchical architectures optimized for minimal resistance and material cost to dense networks that achieve efficient perfusion. Notably, metabolic demand is the primary factor modulating the transition between these contrasting structures. By applying our adaptation rule to networks in the rat mesentery and comparing the resulting optimal perfusion architectures with the experimental data, we can estimate the biologically relevant parameters, such as the oxygen absorption rate, for which the optimization and experimental networks align the most. Surprisingly, the optimal absorption rate we derive matches independent in vivo measurements. This suggests that reduced-order models like ours can provide valuable insights into the development and function of real vascular networks.","2024-11","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2025-07-24 20:26:37","2024-12-23","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 2024 DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2111.04657","","","","Nonlinear Sciences - Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems; Physics - Biological Physics; Quantitative Biology - Tissues and Organs","","","","","Gounaris, Georgios; Jovchevska, Mija; Garcia, Miguel Ruiz; Katifori, Eleni","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blood clotting and thromboembolism play a central role in the pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke. An increasing number of recent studies indicate changes in blood clot structure and composition in patients with ischaemic stroke. In this review, we aim to summarise and discuss clot structure, function and composition in ischaemic stroke, including its relationships with clinical diagnosis and treatment options such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Studies are summarised in which clot structure and composition is analysed both in vitro from patients' plasma samples and ex vivo in thrombi obtained through interventional catheter-mediated thrombectomy. Mechanisms that drive clot composition and architecture such as neutrophil extracellular traps and clot contraction are also discussed. We find that, while in vitro clot structure in plasma samples from ischaemic stroke patients are consistently altered, showing denser clots that are more resistant to fibrinolysis, current data on the composition and architecture of ex vivo clots obtained by thrombectomy are more variable. With the potential of advances in technologies underpinning both the imaging and retrieving of clots, we expect that future studies in this area will generate new data that is of interest for the diagnosis, optimal treatment strategies and clinical management of patients with ischaemic stroke.","2024-07","2025-07-24 20:26:38","2025-07-24 20:26:38","2025-07-22","3–10","","","550","","","","ISCHEMIC STROKE: From fibrinolysis to functional recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: stantonIschaemicStrokeThromboembolism2024","","","","clot structure; fibrinogen; fibrinolysis; stroke; thrombectomy; thromboembolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hypoxia alters cancer cell metabolism and contributes to therapy resistance by inducing cell quiescence. Hypoxia stimulates a complex cell signaling network in cancer cells, including the HIF, PI3K, MAPK, and NFKB pathways, which interact with each other causing positive and negative feedback loops and enhancing or diminishing hypoxic effects. This review provides background knowledge on the role of tumor hypoxia and the role of the HIF cell signaling involved in tumor blood vessel formation, metastasis, and development of the resistance to therapy.

The vast number of blood vessels in the circulatory system, more than 109, implies that vessels' arrangement and structure are not under individual genetic control but emerge as a result of generic responses of each segment to the various stimuli that it experiences. To obtain insight into the types of response that are needed, a network-oriented approach has been used, in which theoretical models are used to simulate structural adaptation in vascular networks, and the results are compared with experimental observations. With regard to the structural control of vessel diameters, this approach shows that responses to both haemodynamic and metabolic stimuli are needed for the formation of functionally adequate and efficient network structures. Furthermore, information transfer in both upstream and downstream directions is essential for balancing flows between long and short flow pathways. Otherwise, functional shunting occurs, that is, short pathways become enlarged and flow bypasses longer pathways. Information transfer in the upstream direction is achieved by conducted responses communicated along vessel walls. Simulations of structural adaptation in tumour microvascular networks indicate that impaired vascular communication, resulting in functional shunting, may be an important factor causing the dysfunctional microcirculation and local hypoxia typically observed in tumours. Anti-angiogenic treatment of tumours may restore vascular communication and thereby improve or normalize flow distribution in tumour vasculature.","2012","2025-07-24 20:26:38","2025-07-24 20:26:38","2024-09-19","63–69","","1","110","","","","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: Secomb2012 tex.copyright: © 2011 The Authors.

A balanced and dynamically regulated capillary remodeling will therefore ensure optimal distribution of blood and nutrients to the tissues. This is particularly important in pathological context in which deficient or excessive vascular remodeling may worsen tissue perfusion and hamper tissue repair. Blood flow is a major determinant of microvascular reshaping since capillaries are pruned when relatively less perfused and they split when exposed to high flow in order to shape the microvascular network for optimal tissue perfusion and oxygenation. The molecular machinery underlying blood flow sensing by endothelial cells is being deciphered, but much less is known about how this translates into endothelial cell responses as alignment, polarization and directed migration to drive capillary remodeling, particularly in vivo. Part of this knowledge is theoretical from computational models since blood flow hemodynamics are not easily recapitulated by in vitro or ex vivo approaches. Moreover, these events are difficult to visualize in vivo due their infrequency and briefness. Studies had been limited to postnatal mouse retina and vascular beds in zebrafish but new tools as advanced microscopy and image analysis are strengthening our understanding of capillary remodeling. In this review we introduce the concept of remodeling of the microvasculature and its relevance in physiology and pathology. We summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms contributing to capillary regression and to capillary splitting highlighting the key role of blood flow to orchestrate this process. Finally, we comment the potential and possibilities that microfluidics offers to this field. Since capillary remodeling mechanisms are often reactivated in prevalent pathologies as cancer and cardiovascular disease, all this knowledge could be eventually used to improve the functionality of capillary networks in diseased tissues and promote their repair.","2020","2025-07-24 20:26:38","2025-07-24 20:26:38","","586852","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: ricardosantamariaRemodelingMicrovasculatureMay2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we develop a theoretical framework for a stochastic self-organized branching process in the presence of external cues. Combining analytical theory with numerical simulations, we predict differential signatures of global vs. local regulatory mechanisms on the branching pattern, such as angle distributions, domain size, and space-filling efficiency. We find that branch alignment follows a generic scaling law determined by the strength of global guidance, while local interactions influence the tissue density but not its overall territory.

It plays a key role in many biological processes, including embryonic development and wound healing, and contributes to many diseases including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The structure of the resulting vessel networks determines their ability to deliver nutrients and remove waste products from biological tissues. Here we simulate the Anderson-Chaplain model of angiogenesis at different parameter values and quantify the vessel architectures of the resulting synthetic data. Specifically, we propose a topological data analysis (TDA) pipeline for systematic analysis of the model. TDA is a vibrant and relatively new field of computational mathematics for studying the shape of data. We compute topological and standard descriptors of model simulations generated by different parameter values. We show that TDA of model simulation data stratifies parameter space into regions with similar vessel morphology. The methodologies proposed here are widely applicable to other synthetic and experimental data including wound healing, development, and plant biology., Vascular networks play a key role in many physiological processes, by delivering nutrition to, and removing waste from, biological tissues. In cancer, tumors stimulate the growth of new blood vessels, via a process called angiogenesis. The resulting vascular structure comprises many inter-connected vessels which lead to emergent morphologies that influence the rate of tumor growth and treatment efficacy. In this work, we consider several approaches to summarize the morphology of synthetic vascular networks generated from a mathematical model of tumor-induced angiogenesis. We find that a topological approach can be used quantify vascular morphology of model simulations and group the simulations into biologically interpretable clusters.

The model allows us to discuss the role of the endothelial cells' chemotactic response and proliferation rate as key factors that tailor the neovascular network.

The model reproduces the in vivo patterns of newly formed vascular networks, providing quantitative and qualitative results for branch density and vessel diameter on the order of the ones measured experimentally in mouse retinas.

For a total number of 2592 segments, a strong unified dependence of wall shear stress on intravascular pressure for arterioles, capillaries, and venules was obtained. All three types of segments exhibit an essentially identical variation of shear stress from high to low values (from ≈100 to 10 dyne/cm2) as intravascular pressure falls from 70 to 15 mm Hg. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that vascular beds grow and adapt so as to maintain the shear stress in each vessel at a level that depends on local transmural pressure.

For a given vascular architecture, flow resistance is determined by the rheological behavior of blood flowing through microvessels. A new approach for calculating the contribution of blood rheology to microvascular flow resistance is presented. Morphology (diameter and length), flow velocity, hematocrit, and topological position were determined for all vessel segments (up to 913) of terminal microcirculatory networks in the rat mesentery by intravital microscopy. Flow velocity and hematocrit were also predicted from mathematical flow simulations, in which the assumed dependence of flow resistance on diameter, hematocrit, and shear rate was optimized to minimize the deviation between measured and predicted values. For microvessels with diameters below approximately 40 microns, the resulting flow resistances are markedly higher and show a stronger dependence on hematocrit than previously estimated from measurements of blood flow in narrow glass tubes. For example, flow resistance in 10-microns microvessels at normal hematocrit is found to exceed that of a corresponding glass tube by a factor of approximately 4. In separate experiments, flow resistance of microvascular networks was estimated from direct measurements of total pressure drop and volume flow, at systemic hematocrits intentionally varied from 0.08 to 0.68. The results agree closely with predictions based on the above-optimized resistance but not with predictions based on glass-tube data. The unexpectedly high flow resistance in small microvessels may be related to interactions between blood components and the inner vessel surface that do not occur in smooth-walled tubes.","1994-11","2025-07-24 20:26:38","2025-07-24 20:26:38","","904–915","","5","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: axelr.priesResistanceBloodFlow1994 PMID: 7923637","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the deposition of several hundred Grays in the microbeam paths, the normal brain tissues presents a high tolerance which is accompanied by the permanence of apparently normal vessels. Conversely, the efficiency of MRT on tumor growth control is thought to be related to a preferential damaging of tumor blood vessels. The high resistance of the healthy vascular network was demonstrated in different animal models by in vivo biphoton microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and histological studies. While a transient increase in permeability was shown, the structure of the vessels remained intact. The use of a chick chorioallantoic membrane at different stages of development showed that the damages induced by microbeams depend on vessel maturation. In vivo and ultrastructural observations showed negligible effects of microbeams on the mature vasculature at late stages of development; nevertheless a complete destruction of the immature capillary plexus was found in the microbeam paths. The use of MRT in rodent models revealed a preferential effect on tumor vessels. Although no major modification was observed in the vasculature of normal brain tissue, tumors showed a denudation of capillaries accompanied by transient increased permeability followed by reduced tumor perfusion and finally, a decrease in number of tumor vessels. Thus, MRT is a very promising treatment strategy with pronounced tumor control effects most likely based on the anti-vascular effects of MRT.","2015-09","2025-07-24 20:26:38","2025-07-24 20:26:38","2025-07-01","634–641","","6","31","","","","Radiation Therapy with Synchrotron Radiation: Achievements and Challenges","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: bouchetEffectsMicrobeamRadiation2015","","","","Healthy tissue; Microbeam radiation therapy; Tumor; Vessels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following the creation of a preliminary pathway with the guidance of field experts and authoritative reviews, a scoping review was conducted that informed final key event (KE) selection and evaluation of the Bradford Hill criteria for the KE relationships (KERs). The AOP begins with a molecular initiating event of deposition of energy; ionization events increase oxidative stress, which when persistent concurrently causes the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, suppresses anti-inflammatory mechanisms and alters stress response signaling pathways. These KEs alter nitric oxide levels leading to endothelial dysfunction, and subsequent abnormal vascular remodeling (the adverse outcome). The work identifies evidence needed to strengthen understanding of the causal associations for the KERs, emphasizing where there are knowledge gaps and uncertainties in both qualitative and quantitative understanding.

Angiogenesis is tightly regulated at the molecular level. Dysregulation of angiogenesis occurs in various pathologies and is one of the hallmarks of cancer. The imbalance of pro- and anti-angiogenic signaling within tumors creates an abnormal vascular network that is characterized by dilated, tortuous, and hyperpermeable vessels. The physiological consequences of these vascular abnormalities include temporal and spatial heterogeneity in tumor blood flow and oxygenation and increased tumor interstitial fluid pressure. These abnormalities and the resultant microenvironment fuel tumor progression, and also lead to a reduction in the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. With the discovery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a major driver of tumor angiogenesis, efforts have focused on novel therapeutics aimed at inhibiting VEGF activity, with the goal of regressing tumors by starvation. Unfortunately, clinical trials of anti-VEGF monotherapy in patients with solid tumors have been largely negative. Intriguingly, the combination of anti-VEGF therapy with conventional chemotherapy has improved survival in cancer patients compared with chemotherapy alone. These seemingly paradoxical results could be explained by a “normalization” of the tumor vasculature by anti-VEGF therapy. Preclinical studies have shown that anti-VEGF therapy changes tumor vasculature towards a more “mature” or “normal” phenotype. This “vascular normalization” is characterized by attenuation of hyperpermeability, increased vascular pericyte coverage, a more normal basement membrane, and a resultant reduction in tumor hypoxia and interstitial fluid pressure. These in turn can lead to an improvement in the metabolic profile of the tumor microenvironment, the delivery and efficacy of exogenously administered therapeutics, the efficacy of radiotherapy and of effector immune cells, and a reduction in number of metastatic cells shed by tumors into circulation in mice. These findings are consistent with data from clinical trials of anti-VEGF agents in patients with various solid tumors. More recently, genetic and pharmacological approaches have begun to unravel some other key regulators of vascular normalization such as proteins that regulate tissue oxygen sensing (PHD2) and vessel maturation (PDGFRβ, RGS5, Ang1/2, TGF-β). Here, we review the pathophysiology of tumor angiogenesis, the molecular underpinnings and functional consequences of vascular normalization, and the implications for treatment of cancer and nonmalignant diseases.","2011-07","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-01","1071–1121","","3","91","","","","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: goelNormalizationVasculatureTreatment2011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although mouse models and correlative patient data indicate that the lymphatic capillary density directly correlates with functional output, i.e., tissue fluid drainage and trafficking efficiency of dendritic cells, the mechanisms ensuring efficient tissue coverage remain poorly understood. Here, we use the mouse ear pinna lymphatic vessel network as a model system and combine lineage-tracing, genetic perturbations, whole-organ reconstructions and theoretical modeling to show that the dermal lymphatic capillaries tile space in an optimal, space-filling manner. This coverage is achieved by two complementary mechanisms: initial tissue invasion provides a non-optimal global scaffold via self-organized branching morphogenesis, while VEGF-C dependent side-branching from existing capillaries rapidly optimizes local coverage by directionally targeting low-density regions. With these two ingredients, we show that a minimal biophysical model can reproduce quantitatively whole-network reconstructions, across development and perturbations.

Nature features transport networks that are adaptive over a vast range of parameters, thus providing an impressive level of robustness in supply. Theoretical and experimental studies have found that real-world transport networks exhibit both tree-like motifs and cycles. When the network is subject to load fluctuations, the presence of cyclic motifs may help to reduce flow fluctuations and, thus, render supply in the network more robust. While previous studies considered network topology via optimization principles, here, we take a dynamical systems approach and study a simple model of a flow network with dynamically adapting weights (conductances). We assume a spatially non-uniform distribution of rapidly fluctuating loads in the sinks and investigate what network configurations are dynamically stable. The network converges to a spatially non-uniform stable configuration composed of both cyclic and tree-like structures. Cyclic structures emerge locally in a transcritical bifurcation as the amplitude of the load fluctuations is increased. The resulting adaptive dynamics thus partitions the network into two distinct regions with cyclic and tree-like structures. The location of the boundary between these two regions is determined by the amplitude of the fluctuations. These findings may explain why natural transport networks display cyclic structures in the micro-vascular regions near terminal nodes, but tree-like features in the regions with larger veins.","2017-11","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-17","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: martensTransitionsTreesCycles2017 Publisher: Frontiers","","","","adaptive networks; cycles; flow networks; heterogeneous network structures; loops; self-organizing networks; Transcritical bifurcation; transport networks; Tree-like structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Binary (black/white) vascular patterns of the human retina originating at the optic disc were obtained by semi-automatic computer processing of digital images from 60-degree fundus fluorescein angiography of 5 normal eyes and 5 eyes with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). As determined by image resolution, vascular patterns included vessels with diameters >or=50 microm and excluded small vessels and capillaries. The density of linearized (i.e., skeletonized) vascular patterns in the macular region versus paramacular region (termed ""region-based"" linearized vascular pattern) was quantified with the fractal dimension (D(f)) and confirmed by grid intersection (rho(v)). RESULTS: By region-based quantification, D(f) and rho( v) were significantly higher in the normal macular region than in the NPDR macular region (p = 0.008 and p = 0.019, respectively). However, differences in D(f) and rho(v) between the normal and NPDR paramacular regions were not strongly significant (p = 0.168 and p = 0.337, respectively).

Endothelial cells are critically affected during the angiogenic process as their proliferation, motility, and morphology are modulated by pro-angiogenic and environmental factors associated with tumor tissues and cancer cells. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that the gap junctions of endothelial cells also participate in the promotion of angiogenesis. Pro-angiogenic factors modulate gap junction function and connexin expression in endothelial cells, whereas endothelial connexins are involved in angiogenic tube formation and in the cell migration of endothelial cells. Several mechanisms, including gap junction function-dependent or -independent pathways, have been proposed. In particular, connexins might have the potential to regulate cell mechanics such as cell morphology, cell migration, and cellular stiffness that are dynamically changed during the angiogenic processes.

Newly formed vascular plexus during development are immature and required dynamic remodeling to generate well-patterned functional networks. This is achieved by remodeling of the capillaries preserving those which are functional and eliminating other ones. A balanced and dynamically regulated capillary remodeling will therefore ensure optimal distribution of blood and nutrients to the tissues. This is particularly important in pathological context in which deficient or excessive vascular remodeling may worsen tissue perfusion and hamper tissue repair. Blood flow is a major determinant of microvascular reshaping since capillaries are pruned when relatively less perfused and they split when exposed to high flow in order to shape the microvascular network for optimal tissue perfusion and oxygenation. The molecular machinery underlying blood flow sensing by endothelial cells is being deciphered, but much less is known about how this translates into endothelial cell responses as alignment, polarization and directed migration to drive capillary remodeling, particularly in vivo. Part of this knowledge is theoretical from computational models since blood flow hemodynamics are not easily recapitulated by in vitro or ex vivo approaches. Moreover, these events are difficult to visualize in vivo due their infrequency and briefness. Studies had been limited to postnatal mouse retina and vascular beds in zebrafish but new tools as advanced microscopy and image analysis are strengthening our understanding of capillary remodeling. In this review we introduce the concept of remodeling of the microvasculature and its relevance in physiology and pathology. We summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms contributing to capillary regression and to capillary splitting highlighting the key role of blood flow to orchestrate this process. Finally, we comment the potential and possibilities that microfluidics offers to this field. Since capillary remodeling mechanisms are often reactivated in prevalent pathologies as cancer and cardiovascular disease, all this knowledge could be eventually used to improve the functionality of capillary networks in diseased tissues and promote their repair.","2020","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","","586852","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: ricardosantamariaRemodelingMicrovasculatureMay2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show how hierarchically organized reticulation can be generated and maintained through spatially collective load fluctuations on a particular length scale. We demonstrate that the resulting network topologies represent a trade-off between optimizing power dissipation, construction cost, and damage robustness and identify the Pareto-efficient front that evolution is expected to favor and select for.

In biological systems, it is believed that such an optimal state is slowly achieved through natural selection. However, general coarse grained models for flow networks with local positive feedback rules for the vessel conductivity typically get trapped in low efficiency, local minima.

Sprouting angiogenesis can be seen as a very crude way of laying out a primitive vessel network (the raw material), while remodelling (understood as pruning of redundant vessels, diameter control, and the establishment of vessel identity and hierarchy) is the key to turning that primitive network into a functional network. This multiscale problem is of prime importance in the development of a functional vasculature. In addition, defective remodelling (either during developmental remodelling or due to a reactivation of the remodelling programme caused by an injury) is associated with a significant number of diseases. In this review, we discuss existing mathematical models of developmental remodelling and explore the important contributions that these models have made to the field of vascular development. These mathematical models are effectively used to investigate and predict vascular development and are able to reproduce experimentally observable results. Moreover, these models provide a useful means of hypothesis generation and can explain the underlying mechanisms driving the observed structural and functional network development.

Our model extends existing models of tumour spheroid growth by incorporating vessel deformation due to mechanical forces between vessel walls and neighbouring tumour cells. These forces generate an effective pressure which compresses vessels, driving occlusion and pruning. This, in turn, leads to a hypoxic oxygen landscape which stimulates angiogenesis. A key feature of our model is the treatment of mechanical cell interactions with the tumour microenvironment, which we represent with two forces. The first is Stokes' drag which is widely used in ABMs to represent resistance to cell movement. The second is a friction force which accounts for resistance due to the continual breaking and reforming of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions. The importance of this friction force is demonstrated by numerical simulation. When Stokes' drag dominates, pressure gradients dissipate across the tissue and vessel compression is negligible. By contrast, as the strength of the friction force increases, larger pressure gradients form, leading to significant vessel compression. We perform extensive numerical simulations to investigate how model parameters that control vascular remodelling and friction influence tumour vascularisation, which we spatially quantify using the cross-pair correlation function. This, in turn, alters the oxygen landscape and drives changes in tumour morphology. Finally, we highlight the importance of accounting for both mechanisms when simulating tumour responses to treatment with radiotherapy. We observe that vascular remodelling critically alters the tumour's susceptibility to treatment and post-radiotherapy regrowth. Tumour regrowth is especially impacted by vessel remodelling, with certain vascular landscapes able to rebound quickly post-radiotherapy, resulting in fast tumour regrowth. Author Summary We have created an agent-based model (ABM) that accounts for mechanical interactions between tumour cells and associated vasculature. The model simulates vessel occlusion and pruning due to compression by neighbouring tumour cells; and growth of new vessels in response to hypoxia. Incorporating pressure-mediated vessel occlusion into our ABM required development of a friction force representing cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. Through numerical simulations, we show that when friction is neglected, pressure gradients dissipate throughout the tissue and vessel compression is negligible. By contrast, as the strength of the friction force increases, larger pressure gradients form, leading to significant vessel compression. We perform extensive model simulations, to investigate how changes in the oxygen landscape caused by vascular remodelling affect the tumour's growth dynamics and composition. We show further how vessel remodelling influences a tumour's response to radiotherapy. We find tumour regrowth to be especially sensitive to vessel remodelling, with certain vascular landscapes growing rapidly post-radiotherapy, and accelerating tumour regrowth.","2025-03","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-04-26","","","","","","","","","","","","Cancer Biology","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: fanExploringRelationshipVascular2025 DOI: 10.1101/2025.03.17.643670 tex.archiveprefix: Cancer Biology","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As it forages, Physarum dynamically rearranges its network structure as a response to local stimuli information, optimising the connection between food sources. This high-level behaviour was already exploited to solve numerous optimisation problems. We develop a flow-based model for the adaptive network formation of Physarum, which solves some inconsistencies of previous models. We first derive a general class of equations describing the adaptation and flow dynamics of a static network comprised of elastic channels filled with an incompressible fluid undergoing a Hagen-Poiseuille flow. An explicit form of the model is obtained by minimising the total power dissipated by the network. Considering a more general functional form of the adaptive equations, a phase transition in the system is also found. The model is used for maze-solving and to build efficient and resilient networks in an arena mimicking mainland Portugal. By comparing the resulting networks with the real Portuguese railway system, we found that the model produced networks with a better overall performance when considering fluctuations in the network flows. Finally, the adaption model is extended to incorporate the network growth in the presence of multiple food sources. The coupling of both processes produces networks with similar traits to several network systems found in nature. We found that when the food sources operate alternately, the model can replicate the direct connections between the food sources observed in Physarum.","2023-05","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2024-12-23","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 2023Almeida DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2305.12244","","","","Physics - Fluid Dynamics","","","","","Almeida, Rodrigo; Dilão, Rui","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One fundamental feature of many leaf venation patterns, especially in the case of angiosperm leaves, is the presence of anastomoses. Anastomosing veins distinguish a network topologically from a simple dendritic (tree-like) pattern which represents the primitive venation architecture. The high degree of interspecific variation of entire venation patterns as well as phenotypic plasticity of some venation properties, such as venation density, indicate the high selective pressure acting on this branching system. Few investigations deal with functional properties of the leaf venation system. The interrelationships between topological or geometric properties of the various leaf venation patterns and functional aspects are far from being well understood. In this review we summarize current knowledge of interrelationships between the form and function of leaf venation and the evolution of leaf venation patterns. Since the functional aspects of architectural features of different leaf venation patterns are considered, the review also refers to the topic of individual and intraspecific variation. One basic function of leaf venation is represented by its contribution to the mechanical behaviour of a leaf. Venation geometry and density influences mechanical stability and may affect, for example, susceptibility to herbivory. Transport of water and carbohydrates is the other basic function of this system and the transport properties are also influenced by the venation architecture. These various functional aspects can be interpreted in an ecophysiological context.","2001-05","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","","553–566","","5","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: anitaroth-nebelsickEvolutionFunctionLeaf2001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increased oxygenation and perfusion have been documented during radiation therapy. Conversely, apoptosis of endothelial cells in irradiated tumors has been proposed as a major contributor to tumor control. To examine these contradictions, we use multiphoton microscopy in two murine tumor models: MC38, a highly vascularized, and B16F10, a moderately vascularized model, grown in transgenic mice with tdTomato-labeled endothelium before and after a single (15 Gy) or fractionated (5 × 3 Gy) dose of radiation. Unexpectedly, even these high doses lead to little structural change of the perfused vasculature. Conversely, non-perfused vessels and blind ends are substantially impaired after radiation accompanied by apoptosis and reduced proliferation of their endothelium. RNAseq analysis of tumor endothelial cells confirms the modification of gene expression in apoptotic and cell cycle regulation pathways after irradiation. Therefore, we conclude that apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells after radiation does not impair vascular structure.","2022-09","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-01","e53221","","9","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: kaepplerEndothelialCellDeath2022 Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","apoptosis; intravital imaging; radiotherapy; tumor endothelial cells; tumor vasculature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Normal vasculatures generally start off as a disorganized capillary lattice which progressively matures into a well-organized vascular loop comprising a hierarchy of arteries and veins. One striking feature of vascular development is the interlacing of arteries and veins. How arteries and veins manage to avoid themselves and interlace with such a perfect architecture is not understood. Here we present a detailed view of the development of the vasculature in the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo. We find that the origin of arteriovenous interlacing lies in the presence of an increased hemodynamic resistance at the distal part of the arteries due to vascular flattening onto the ectodermal surface. This reduces the vascular conductance distally, thus repelling veins away. In more proximal parts, vessels round off into cylinders and the increased flow attracts veins.","2018-12","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2024-09-19","1–11","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: Richard2018 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group tex.copyright: 2018 The Author(s)","","","","Angiogenesis; Cardiovascular biology; Time-lapse imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated the association between radiation exposure and EDV among fluoroscopy-guided interventional procedure specialists and explored the possible mechanisms. Materials and Methods Brachial flow-mediated dilation was compared in 21 interventional cardiologists (the radiation group) and 15 noninterventional cardiologists (the nonradiation group). Animal radiation experiments were also performed to observe the impact of radiation on EDV. Results Flow-mediated dilation in both the left (radiation group, 3.63% vs. nonradiation group, 6.77%; P < .001) and right brachial arteries (5.36% vs. 7.33%, respectively; P = .04) and serum nitric oxide (NO) level (343.69 vs. 427.09 𝜇mol/L, respectively; P = .02) were significantly reduced in the radiation group compared to those in the nonradiation group. EDV was significantly impaired in acetylcholine concentrations of 3 × 10-6 mol/L and 10-5 mol/L (60.09% vs.74.79%, respectively; P = .03; and 62.73% vs. 80.56%, respectively; P = .002), and reactive oxygen species levels in the aorta intima and media layers were significantly increased in mice after a single x-ray exposure, which could be partly rescued by pretreatment with folic acid (P < .05). Conclusions Radiation exposure can lead to impairment of flow-mediated vasodilation in human or EDV in mice. In mice acutely exposed to radiation, folic acid alleviated radiation-induced EDV impairment by possible reduction of reactive oxidative species.","2020-01","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-01","42–48","","1","31","","","Association between Radiation Exposure and Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: zhuAssociationRadiationExposure2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the reported results are inconsistent, they can be generalized as follows. In the human tumors treated with conventional fractionated radiotherapy, the morphological and functional status of the vasculature is preserved, if not improved, during the early part of a treatment course and then decreases toward the end of treatment. Irradiation of human tumor xenografts or rodent tumors with 5-10 Gy in a single dose causes relatively mild vascular damages, but increasing the radiation dose to higher than 10 Gy/fraction induces severe vascular damage resulting in reduced blood perfusion. Little is known about the vascular changes in human tumors treated with high-dose hypofractionated radiation such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). However, the results for experimental tumors strongly indicate that SBRT or SRS of human tumors with doses higher than about 10 Gy/fraction is likely to induce considerable vascular damages and thereby damages the intratumor microenvironment, leading to indirect tumor cell death. Vascular damage may play an important role in the response of human tumors to high-dose hypofractionated SBRT or SRS.","2012-03","2025-07-24 20:26:39","2025-07-24 20:26:39","","311–327","","3","177","","","Radiation-induced vascular damage in tumors","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: parkRadiationinducedVascularDamage2012 PMID: 22229487","","","","Animals; Humans; Neoplasms; Blood Vessels; Dose Fractionation Radiation; Oxygen; Radiation Injuries; Radiosurgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poor blood perfusion, in conjunction with increased hypoxia and oxygen heterogeneity, impairs a tumour's response to radiotherapy. The optimal strategy for enhancing tumour perfusion remains unclear, preventing its regular deployment in combination therapies. In this work, we first identify vascular architectural features that correlate with enhanced perfusion following radiotherapy, using in vivo imaging data from vascular tumours. Then, we present a novel computational model to determine the relationship between these architectural features and blood perfusion in silico. If perfusion is defined to be the proportion of vessels that support blood flow, we find that vascular networks with small mean diameters and large numbers of angiogenic sprouts show the largest increases in perfusion post-irradiation for both biological and synthetic tumours. We also identify cases where perfusion increases due to the pruning of hypoperfused vessels, rather than blood being rerouted. These results indicate the importance of considering network composition when determining the optimal irradiation strategy. In the future, we aim to use our findings to identify tumours that are good candidates for perfusion enhancement and to improve the efficacy of combination therapies.","2024-02","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-06-30","e1011252","","2","20","","","Enhanced perfusion following exposure to radiotherapy","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: koryEnhancedPerfusionFollowing2024a Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","Tumor angiogenesis; Blood flow; Cancers and neoplasms; Cancer treatment; Flow rate; Malignant tumors; Perfusion; Radiation therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A public screening is highly desirable for prompt and effective treatment, since such diseases need to be diagnosed at an early stage. Automated and accurate segmentation of the retinal blood vessel tree is one of the challenging tasks in the computer-aided analysis of fundus images today. We improve the concept of matched filtering, and propose a novel and accurate method for segmenting retinal vessels. Our goal is to be able to segment blood vessels with varying vessel diameters in high-resolution colour fundus images. All recent authors compare their vessel segmentation results to each other using only low-resolution retinal image databases. Consequently, we provide a new publicly available high-resolution fundus image database of healthy and pathological retinas. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed blood vessel segmentation approach is at least comparable with recent state-of-the-art methods.

Originally conceived as a text for a one-semester course, it is directed to undergraduate students whose studies of calculus sequence have included definitions and proofs of theorems. The book's principal aim is to provide a simple, thorough survey of elementary topics in the study of collections of objects, or sets, that possess a mathematical structure. The author begins with an informal discussion of set theory in Chapter 1, reserving coverage of countability for Chapter 5, where it appears in the context of compactness. In the second chapter Professor Mendelson discusses metric spaces, paying particular attention to various distance functions which may be defined on Euclidean n-space and which lead to the ordinary topology. Chapter 3 takes up the concept of topological space, presenting it as a generalization of the concept of a metric space. Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to a discussion of the two most important topological properties: connectedness and compactness. Throughout the text, Dr. Mendelson, a former Professor of Mathematics at Smith College, has included many challenging and stimulating exercises to help students develop a solid grasp of the material presented.","2019-07","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","","","","","","","","Introduction to Topology","","","","","Igal Meirovich","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: mendelsonIntroductionTopologyThird2019 tex.googlebooks: rjYmxwEACAAJ","","","","Mathematics / Topology; Mathematics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial-cell migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumors. In this paper we present both continuous and discrete mathematical models which describe the formation of the capillary sprout network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take into account essential endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule fibronectin. The continuous model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the initial migratory response of endothelial cells to the TAF and the fibronectin. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and compared qualitatively with in vivo experiments. We then use a discretized form of the partial differential equations to develop a biased random-walk model which enables us to track individual endothelial cells at the sprout tips and incorporate anastomosis, mitosis and branching explicitly into the model. The theoretical capillary networks generated by computer simulations of the discrete model are compared with the morphology of capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments.","1998-09","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","","857–899","","5","60","","","","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: andersonContinuousDiscreteMathematical1998 PMID: 9739618","","","","Angiogenesis Inducing Agents; Animals; Arteriovenous Anastomosis; Capillaries; Cell Communication; Cell Division; Computer Simulation; Fibronectins; Humans; Mitosis; Stochastic Processes; Models Biological; Neoplasms Experimental; Neovascularization Pathologic; Endothelium Vascular; Numerical Analysis Computer-Assisted","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has raised hope that an anti-angiogenic treatment may be effective in the fight against cancer. Here we formulate, using the theory of reinforced random walks, an individual cell-based mathematical model of tumour angiogenesis in response to a diffusible angiogenic factor. The early stages of angiogenesis, in which endothelial cells (EC) escape the parent vessel and invade the extra-cellular matrix, are included in the model, as are the action of a proteolytic enzyme, EC proliferation and capillary branching and anastomosis. The anti-angiogenic potential of angiostatin, a known inhibitor of angiogenesis, is also examined.

Although they are closely related biologically, no current model explains both phenomena with a single biophysical mechanism. Most computational models describe sprouting at the level of the blood vessel, ignoring how cell behavior drives branch splitting during sprouting. We present a cell-based, Glazier–Graner–Hogeweg model (also called Cellular Potts Model) simulation of the initial patterning before the vascular cords form lumens, based on plausible behaviors of endothelial cells. The endothelial cells secrete a chemoattractant, which attracts other endothelial cells. As in the classic Keller–Segel model, chemotaxis by itself causes cells to aggregate into isolated clusters. However, including experimentally observed VE-cadherin–mediated contact inhibition of chemotaxis in the simulation causes randomly distributed cells to organize into networks and cell aggregates to sprout, reproducing aspects of both de novo and sprouting blood-vessel growth. We discuss two branching instabilities responsible for our results. Cells at the surfaces of cell clusters attempting to migrate to the centers of the clusters produce a buckling instability. In a model variant that eliminates the surface–normal force, a dissipative mechanism drives sprouting, with the secreted chemical acting both as a chemoattractant and as an inhibitor of pseudopod extension. Both mechanisms would also apply if force transmission through the extracellular matrix rather than chemical signaling mediated cell–cell interactions. The branching instabilities responsible for our results, which result from contact inhibition of chemotaxis, are both generic developmental mechanisms and interesting examples of unusual patterning instabilities.","2008-09","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-16","e1000163","","9","4","","","","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: merksContactInhibitedChemotaxisNovo2008g Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","Angiogenesis; Endothelial cells; Chemotaxis; Biophysical simulations; Blood vessels; Cell adhesion; Cell motility; Vasculogenesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diameter of each vascular segment was assumed to change with time in response to four local stimuli: endothelial wall shear stress (tauw), intravascular pressure (P), a flow-dependent metabolic stimulus (M), and a stimulus conducted from distal to proximal segments along vascular walls (C). Increases in tauw, M, or C or decreases in P were assumed to stimulate diameter increases. Hemodynamic quantities were estimated using a mathematical model of network flow. Simulations were continued until equilibrium states were reached in which the stimuli were in balance. Predictions were compared with data from intravital microscopy of the rat mesentery, including topological position, diameter, length, and flow velocity for each segment of complete networks. Stable equilibrium states, with realistic distributions of velocities and diameters, were achieved only when all four stimuli were included. According to the model, responses to tauw and P ensure that diameters are smaller in peripheral than in proximal segments and are larger in venules than in corresponding arterioles, whereas M prevents collapse of networks to single pathways and C suppresses generation of large proximal shunts.","1998-08","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","","H349-360","","2","275","","","Structural adaptation and stability of microvascular networks","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","Citation Key: priesStructuralAdaptationStability1998 PMID: 9683420","","","","Animals; Endothelium Vascular; Adaptation Physiological; Blood Flow Velocity; Blood Pressure; Male; Mathematics; Microcirculation; Models Cardiovascular; Muscle Smooth Vascular; Rats; Rats Wistar; Regional Blood Flow; Stress Mechanical; Time Factors; Venules","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When each spheroid was cultured in a large volume of medium, frequently renewed, all spheroids eventually reached a dormant phase at a diameter of approximately 3–4 mm and a population of approximately 106 cells. In the dormant spheroid, newly generated cells at the periphery balanced those lost by necrosis in the center. We propose that this dormant phase is due to a gradual reduction in the ratio of surface area to volume: a size is achieved beyond which there is insufficient surface area for the spheroid to eliminate catabolites and absorb nutrients. Thus, in the face of unlimited space and of new medium, three-dimensional cell populations become self-regulating. This phenomenon contrasts with standard tissue culture in which cell populations, living on a flat plane in two dimensions, will not stop growing in the face of unlimited space and new medium because the ratio of surface area to volume remains constant. These experiments provide a mechanism for our observations in vivo: before vascularization, solid tumors live by simple diffusion as three-dimensional spheroids or ellipsoids. They become dormant at a diameter of only a few millimeters; once vascularized, they are released from this dormant phase and begin exponential growth. Thus, tumor dormancy resulting from absence of angiogenesis in vivo, may operate by the same mechanism responsible for dormancy of spheroids in vitro.","1973-10","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-16","745–753","","4","138","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: folkmanSELFREGULATIONGROWTHTHREE1973","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although genetic mutations are in general the first step in the development of a cancer, for the mutated cell to persist in a tissue, it must compete against the other, healthy or diseased cells, for example by becoming more motile, adhesive, or multiplying faster. Thus, the cellular phenotype determines the success of a cancer cell in competition with its neighbors, irrespective of the genetic mutations or physiological alterations that gave rise to the altered phenotype. What phenotypes can make a cell “successful” in an environment of healthy and cancerous cells, and how? A widely used tool for getting more insight into that question is cell-based modeling. Cell-based models constitute a class of computational, agent-based models that mimic biophysical and molecular interactions between cells. One of the most widely used cell-based modeling formalisms is the cellular Potts model (CPM), a lattice-based, multi particle cell-based modeling approach. The CPM has become a popular and accessible method for modeling mechanisms of multicellular processes including cell sorting, gastrulation, or angiogenesis. The CPM accounts for biophysical cellular properties, including cell proliferation, cell motility, and cell adhesion, which play a key role in cancer. Multiscale models are constructed by extending the agents with intracellular processes including metabolism, growth, and signaling. Here we review the use of the CPM for modeling tumor growth, tumor invasion, and tumor progression. We argue that the accessibility and flexibility of the CPM, and its accurate, yet coarse-grained and computationally efficient representation of cell and tissue biophysics, make the CPM the method of choice for modeling cellular processes in tumor development.","2013-04","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-16","87","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: szaboCellularPottsModeling2013g PMID: 23596570 tex.pmcid: PMC3627127","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The endothelial cells that comprise our vessel network are viewed as linearly elastic spheres that move in response to the forces they experience. We distinguish two types of endothelial cells: vessel elements are contained within the network and tip cells are located at the ends of vessels. Tip cells move in response to mechanical forces caused by interactions with neighbouring vessel elements and the local tissue environment, chemotactic forces and a persistence force which accounts for their tendency to continue moving in the same direction. Vessel elements are subject to similar mechanical forces but are insensitive to chemotaxis. An angular persistence force representing interactions with the local tissue is introduced to stabilise buckling instabilities caused by cell proliferation. Only vessel elements proliferate, at rates which depend on their degree of stretch: elongated elements have increased rates of proliferation, and compressed elements have reduced rates. Following division, the fate of the new cell depends on the local mechanical environment: the probability of forming a new sprout is increased if the parent vessel is highly compressed and the probability of being incorporated into the parent vessel increased if the parent is stretched. Simulation results reveal that our hybrid model can reproduce the key qualitative features of vasculogenesis. Extensive parameter sensitivity analyses show that significant changes in network size and morphology are induced by varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of the proliferation rate and the sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying the chemotactic sensitivity directly influences the directionality of the networks. The degree of branching, and thereby the density of the networks, is influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs that simultaneously depict several network properties are introduced to show how these and other network quantities change over time and also as model parameters vary. We also show how equivalent glyphs constructed from in vivo data could be used to discriminate between normal and tumour vasculature and, in the longer term, for model validation. We conclude that our biomechanical hybrid model can generate vascular networks that are qualitatively similar to those generated from in vitro and in vivo experiments.","2017-02","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-16","254–268","","","414","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: perfahl3DHybridModelling2017","","","","Angiogenesis; Vasculogenesis; Agent-based modelling; Mechanical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of theoretical models of the interlinked processes that underlie the healing mechanism has yielded considerable insight into aspects of this critical phenomenon that remain difficult to investigate empirically. In particular, the mathematical modeling of angiogenesis, i.e., capillary sprout growth, has offered new paradigms for the understanding of this highly complex and crucial step in the healing pathway. With the recent advances in imaging and cell tracking, the time is now ripe for an appraisal of the utility and importance of mathematical modeling in wound healing angiogenesis research. The purpose of this review is to pedagogically elucidate the conceptual principles that have underpinned the development of mathematical descriptions of wound healing angiogenesis, specifically those that have utilized a continuum reaction-transport framework, and highlight the contribution that such models have made toward the advancement of research in this field. We aim to draw attention to the common assumptions made when developing models of this nature, thereby bringing into focus the advantages and limitations of this approach. A deeper integration of mathematical modeling techniques into the practice of wound healing angiogenesis research promises new perspectives for advancing our knowledge in this area. To this end we detail several open problems related to the understanding of wound healing angiogenesis, and outline how these issues could be addressed through closer cross-disciplinary collaboration.","2015-09","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-24 20:26:40","2025-07-16","262","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: fleggMathematicalModelingWound2015 PMID: 26483695 tex.pmcid: PMC4588694","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the cellular level, the model uses the cellular Potts model based on system-energy reduction to describe endothelial cell migration, growth, division, cellular adhesion, and the evolving structure of the stroma. Numerical simulations show: 1), different tumor-secreted pro-angiogenic factor gradient profiles dramatically affect capillary sprout morphology; 2), average sprout extension speeds depend on the proximity of the proliferating region to the sprout tip, and the coordination of cellular functions; and 3), inhomogeneities in the extravascular tissue lead to sprout branching and anastomosis, phenomena that emerge without any prescribed rules.

We propose that continual flux in Notch signalling levels in individual cells results in differential VE-cadherin turnover and junctional-cortex protrusions, which powers differential cell movement. In cultured endothelial cells, Notch signalling quantitatively reduced junctional VE-cadherin mobility. In simulations, only differential adhesion dynamics generated long-range position changes, required for tip cell competition and stalk cell intercalation. Simulation and quantitative image analysis on VE-cadherin junctional patterning in vivo identified that differential VE-cadherin mobility is lost under pathological high VEGF conditions, in retinopathy and tumour vessels.

Sprouting angiogenesis can be seen as a very crude way of laying out a primitive vessel network (the raw material), while remodelling (understood as pruning of redundant vessels, diameter control, and the establishment of vessel identity and hierarchy) is the key to turning that primitive network into a functional network. This multiscale problem is of prime importance in the development of a functional vasculature. In addition, defective remodelling (either during developmental remodelling or due to a reactivation of the remodelling programme caused by an injury) is associated with a significant number of diseases. In this review, we discuss existing mathematical models of developmental remodelling and explore the important contributions that these models have made to the field of vascular development. These mathematical models are effectively used to investigate and predict vascular development and are able to reproduce experimentally observable results. Moreover, these models provide a useful means of hypothesis generation and can explain the underlying mechanisms driving the observed structural and functional network development. However, developmental vascular remodelling is still a relatively new area in mathematical biology, and many biological questions remain unanswered.

There are several cancer therapy techniques currently being used and developed that target the tumor vasculature for the treatment of solid tumors. This article reviews the aspects of the tumor vasculature that are relevant to most cancer therapies but particularly to vascular targeting techniques. Materials and methods We conducted a review of identified experiments in which tumors were transplanted into animals to study the development of the tumor vasculature with tumor growth. Quantitative vasculature morphology data for spontaneous human head and neck cancers are reviewed. Parameters assessed include the highest microvascular density (h-MVD) and the relative vascular volume (RVV). The effects of the vasculature on the tumor microenvironment are discussed, including the distributions of hypoxia and proliferation. Results Data for the h-MVD and RVV in head and neck cancers are highly varied, partly due to methodological differences. However, it is clear that the cancers are typically more vascularized than the corresponding normal tissue. The commonly observed chronic hypoxia and acute hypoxia in these tumors are due to high intratumor heterogeneity in MVD and lower than normal blood oxygenation levels through the abnormally developed tumor vasculature. Hypoxic regions are associated with decreased cell proliferation. Conclusion The morphology of the vasculature strongly influences the tumor microenvironment, with important implications for tumor response to medical intervention such as radiotherapy. Quantitative vasculature morphology data herein may be used to inform computational models that simulate the spatial tumor vasculature. Such models may play an important role in exploring and optimizing vascular targeting cancer therapies.","2017-04","2025-07-24 20:26:41","2025-07-24 20:26:41","2025-07-16","21–32","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: forsterReviewDevelopmentTumor2017 PMID: 28443291 tex.pmcid: PMC5395278","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Along the way, we also prove analogues of the divergence theorem, Green's identities, and Helmholtz's theorem.

For this reason, they provide a convenient model system for some aspects of tissue growth in higher organisms. A mathematical description of growth and branching in fungi is derived in terms of continuum variables such as densities of filaments and tips of filaments. The equations contain a term for branching which takes on specific mathematical forms for distinct fungal morphologies (lateral or dichotomous branching, anastomosis, etc.). By analysing propagating solutions to these equations it is demonstrated that certain branching strategies may be advantageous to the propagation of the tissue. The model also suggests causes for ring-like patterns occasionally associated with the colonies of certain species of fungi.","1982-10","2025-07-24 20:26:41","2025-07-24 20:26:41","2025-07-22","679–701","","4","98","","","The propagation of fungal colonies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: edelsteinPropagationFungalColonies1982","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Continuum equations are formulated to represent evolving spatial distributions of density given a variety of assumptions about branching and crosslinking kinetics. In accommodating the influence of angular branch distributions, a set of integropartial differential equations are obtained. It is found that crosslinking (which eliminates apical growth) acts as a density-regulating mechanism. If the branching angle ? is small, this mechanism further leads to a phenomenon of orientation selection: It is shown analytically that for small ? a spatially homogeneous network with an initial uniform distribution of branch orientations will align along a single axis as a result of instability of the uniform steady state to small perturbations that are nonuniform in the angular variable. Because instability first occurs to a mode e<sup>il?</sup> for which l = 2, such networks eventually contain only parallel branches. Similar phenomena lead to a transition in properties of spatially propagating networks, whose angular distributions are diffuse for $\varphi > 0.29$ and sharply defined for $\varphi < 0.24$. Other properties of propagating networks, including traveling wave behavior, are described analytically and illustrated by numerical simulations.","1989","2025-07-24 20:26:41","2025-07-24 20:26:41","2025-07-22","1136–1157","","4","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: edelstein-keshetModelsBranchingNetworks1989 JSTOR: 2102010 Publisher: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Visual patterns arise naturally in digital images viewed as sets of non-abstract points endowed with some form of proximity (nearness) relation. Proximity relations make it possible to construct uniform topologies on the sets of points that constitute a digital image. In keeping with an interest in gaining an understanding of digital images themselves as a rich source of patterns, this book introduces the basics of digital images from a computer vision perspective. In parallel with a computer vision perspective on digital images, this book also introduces the basics of proximity spaces. Not only the traditional view of spatial proximity relations but also the more recent descriptive proximity relations are considered. The beauty of the descriptive proximity approach is that it is possible to discover visual set patterns among sets that are non-overlapping and non-adjacent spatially. By combining the spatial proximity and descriptive proximity approaches, the search for salient visual patterns in digital images is enriched, deepened and broadened. A generous provision of Matlab and Mathematica scripts are used in this book to lay bare the fabric and essential features of digital images for those who are interested in finding visual patterns in images. The combination of computer vision techniques and topological methods lead to a deep understanding of images.","2014-02-14","2025-07-24 20:37:00","2025-07-24 20:37:00","","","411","","","","","Topology of Digital Images","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4790ngEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.ca/books?id=4790ngEACAAJ","","Computers / Artificial Intelligence / General; Computers / Optical Data Processing; Computers / Software Development & Engineering / Computer Graphics; Technology & Engineering / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Examples include the air in a balloon, the water in a lake, the electrons in a chunk of metal, and the photons given off by the sun. We can't possibly follow every detail of the motions of so many particles. So in thermal physics we assume that these motions are random, and we use the laws of probability to predict how the material as a whole ought to behave. Alternatively, we can measure the bulk properties of a material, and from these infer something about the particles it is made of. This book will give you a working understanding of thermal physics, assuming that you have already studied introductory physics and calculus. You will learn to apply the general laws of energy and entropy to engines, refrigerators, chemical reactions, phase transformations, and mixtures. You will also learn to use basic quantum physics and powerful statistical methods to predict in detail how temperature affects molecular speeds, vibrations of solids, electrical and magnetic behaviors, emission of light, and exotic low-temperature phenomena.

The diameters, lengths, and branching patterns of the coronary capillary blood vessels in the right and left ventricles of four pigs were measured. The locations of the coronary arterioles and venules were identified, topological maps were constructed, and the mean functional length of capillaries connecting an arteriole to an adjacent venule was measured. The vasculature was fixed by perfusing the coronary vessels with a catalyzed polymer. After the polymer hardened, plugs of the myocardium were removed, sectioned, dehydrated, and cleared to render the capillary network visible in a light microscope. The capillaries then were traced by optical sectioning. We designated the capillaries as blood vessels of order number zero; we further designated the capillaries as those fed directly by arterioles (C0a), those drained directly into venules (C0v), and those capillary vessels connected to C0a and C0v. The capillaries are connected in patterns identified as Y, T, H, or hairpin and anastomosed through capillary cross-connections (Ccc). The Ccc vessels may connect adjacent capillaries or capillaries originating from different arterioles. The connection among the capillaries, arteries, and veins is presented in terms of a connectivity matrix. Combining the present data with those for the arterial and venous trees, we have obtained a complete set of statistical data of all the blood vessels of the heart of the pig.

The network is generated in response to tumour angiogenic factors (TAFs), which are released from hypoxic cells within a solid tumour. We first describe a refined model for tumour-induced angiogenesis, which aims to describe the capillary growth process at the cellular level by explicitly taking into account the effects of matrix degrading enzymes and the local properties of the host tissue during endothelial cell migration. We then incorporate blood rheological properties into the formulation and investigate the influence of wall shear stress induced by the blood flow during dynamic vascular growth. We then go on to examine a number of feedback mechanisms affecting vascular resistance and network architecture. The mechanisms considered include those proposed by Pries and co-workers [A.R. Pries, T.W. Secomb, P. Gaehtgens, Structural adaptation and stability of microvascular networks: theory and simulation, Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 44 (1998) H349–H360; A.R. Pries, B.

Reglin, T.W. Secomb, Structural adaptation of microvascular networks: roles of the pressure response, Hypertension 38 (2001) 1476–1479] and both haemodynamic (non-linear viscosity) and metabolic constraints are taken into account. Subsequent simulations of chemotherapeutic drug perfusion through the system show that vascular adaptation leads to a significant benefit in treatment delivery to the tumour. The results clearly demonstrate that the combined effects of network architecture and vessel compliance should be included in future models of angiogenesis if therapy protocols and treatment efficacy are to be adequately assessed.","2006-07-01","2025-08-21 16:05:44","2025-08-21 16:05:44","2025-08-21 16:05:44","96-123","","1","44","","Mathematical and Computer Modelling","","Advances in Business Modeling and Decision Technologies [pp. 1-95]","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/8N4NNTI3/Stéphanou et al. - 2006 - Mathematical modelling of the influence of blood rheological properties upon adaptative tumour-induc.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/PC7ZIVRT/S0895717705004565.html","","","Angiogenesis; Blood flow; Capillary remodelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using ubiquitous computing infrastructure, we provide a means to go one step further in using computers to understand complex models through instantaneous and interactive exploration.

Here, we present VisualPDE, an online, interactive solver for a broad class of 1D and 2D partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Abstract dynamical systems concepts such as symmetry-breaking instabilities, subcritical bifurcations and the role of initial data in multistable nonlinear models become much more intuitive when you can play with these models yourself, and immediately answer questions about how the system responds to changes in parameters, initial conditions, boundary conditions or even spatiotemporal forcing. Importantly, VisualPDE is freely available, open source and highly customisable. We give several examples in teaching, research and knowledge exchange, providing high-level discussions of how it may be employed in different settings. This includes designing web-based course materials structured around interactive simulations, or easily crafting specific simulations that can be shared with students or collaborators via a simple URL.
