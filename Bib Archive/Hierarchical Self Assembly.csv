To exploit the potential benefits of structures with such “addressable complexity,” we need to understand the factors that optimize the yield and the kinetics of self-assembly. Here we use a simple theoretical method to explain the key features responsible for the unexpected success of DNA-brick experiments, which are currently the only demonstration of reliable self-assembly with such a large number of components. Simulations confirm that our theory accurately predicts the narrow temperature window in which error-free assembly can occur. Even more strikingly, our theory predicts that correct assembly of the complete structure may require a time-dependent experimental protocol. Furthermore, we predict that low coordination numbers result in nonclassical nucleation behavior, which we find to be essential for achieving optimal nucleation kinetics under mild growth conditions. We also show that, rather surprisingly, the use of heterogeneous bond energies improves the nucleation kinetics and in fact appears to be necessary for assembling certain intricate 3D structures. This observation makes it possible to sculpt nucleation pathways by tuning the distribution of interaction strengths. These insights not only suggest how to improve the design of structures based on DNA bricks, but also point the way toward the creation of a much wider class of chemical or colloidal structures with addressable complexity.","2015-05-19","2025-07-22 23:47:31","2025-07-22 23:47:31","2025-07-22 23:47:31","6313-6318","","20","112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pnas.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/D7TBK9V2/Jacobs et al. - 2015 - Rational design of self-assembly pathways for complex multicomponent structures.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specificity between components may arise from a wide variety of physical and chemical mechanisms in diverse contexts, from DNA hybridization to shape-sensitive depletion interactions. Despite this diversity, all systems that rely on interaction specificity operate under the constraint that increasing the number of distinct components inevitably increases off-target binding. Here we introduce “capacity,” the maximal information encodable using specific interactions, to compare specificity across diverse experimental systems and to compute how specificity changes with physical parameters. Using this framework, we find that “shape” coding of interactions has higher capacity than chemical (“color”) coding because the strength of off-target binding is strongly sublinear in binding-site size for shapes while being linear for colors. We also find that different specificity mechanisms, such as shape and color, can be combined in a synergistic manner, giving a capacity greater than the sum of the parts.","2016-05-24","2025-07-23 00:06:48","2025-07-23 00:06:48","2025-07-23 00:06:48","5841-5846","","21","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pnas.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/AVPMBV84/Huntley et al. - 2016 - Information capacity of specific interactions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main difference between them is that the two-dimensional ground state can be easily achieved by simple dynamical processes while in three dimensions, this is impossible due to the difference in the local and global optimal packings. In this paper we show experimentally and numerically that in 2 + ε dimensions, realized by a container which is in one dimension slightly wider than the spheres, the particles organize themselves in a triangular lattice, while touching either the front or rear side of the container. If these positions are denoted by up and down the packing problem can be mapped to a 1/2 spin system. At first it looks frustrated with spin-glass like configurations, but the system has a well defined ground state built up from isosceles triangles. When the system is agitated, it evolves very slowly towards the potential energy minimum through metastable states.

In his early studies of reversible computation, Bennett imagined an enzymatic Turing Machine which modiﬁed a hetero-polymer (such as DNA) to perform computation with asymptotically low energy expenditures. Adleman’s recent experimental demonstration of a DNA computation, using an entirely different approach, has led to a wealth of ideas for how to build DNA-based computers in the laboratory, whose energy efﬁciency, information density, and parallelism may have potential to surpass conventional electronic computers for some purposes. In this thesis, I examine one mechanism used in all designs for DNA-based computer –the self-assembly of DNA by hybridization and formation of the double helix – and show that this mechanism alone in theory can perform universal computation. To do so, I borrow an important result in the mathematical theory of tiling: Wang showed how jigsaw-shaped tiles can be designed to simulate the operation of any Turing Machine. I propose constructing molecular Wang tiles using the branched DNA constructions of Seeman, thereby producing self-assembled and algorithmically patterned two-dimensional lattices of DNA. Simulations of plausible self-assembly kinetics suggest that low error rates can be obtained near the melting temperature of the lattice; under these conditions, self-assembly is performing reversible computation with asymptotically low energy expenditures. Thus encouraged, I have begun an experimental investigation of algorithmic self-assembly. A competition experiment suggests that an individual logical step can proceed correctly by self-assembly, while a companion experiment demonstrates that unpatterned two dimensional lattices of DNA will self-assemble and can be visualized. We have reason to hope, therefore, that this experimental system will prove fruitful for investigating issues in the physics of computation by self-assembly. It may also lead to interesting new materials.","2006-05","2025-08-18 21:57:22","2025-08-18 21:57:22","2025-08-18 21:57:22","4-4","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Okinawa","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/4W5Y4C5K/Winfree - 2006 - Algorithmic Self-Assembly of DNA.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006 International Conference on Microtechnologies in Medicine and Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by ‘top-down’ methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide ‘staple strands’ to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).","2006-03","2025-08-22 18:14:23","2025-08-22 18:14:23","2025-08-22 18:14:23","297-302","","7082","440","","","","","","","","","","en","2006 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/VV6MAS4J/Rothemund - 2006 - Folding DNA to create nanoscale shapes and patterns.pdf","","","Humanities and Social Sciences; multidisciplinary; Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, abstract tiles were translated into DNA tiles based on double-crossover motifs. Serving as input for the computation, long single-stranded DNA molecules were used to nucleate growth of tiles into algorithmic crystals. For both of two independent molecular realizations, atomic force microscopy revealed recognizable Sierpinski triangles containing 100–200 correct tiles. Error rates during assembly appear to range from 1% to 10%. Although imperfect, the growth of Sierpinski triangles demonstrates all the necessary mechanisms for the molecular implementation of arbitrary cellular automata.

However, even incremental steps toward designing functional materials have proven challenging. If the material is constructed from highly complex components, the design space of materials properties rapidly becomes too computationally expensive to search. On the other hand, very simple components such as uniform spherical particles are not powerful enough to capture rich functional behavior. Here, we introduce a differentiable materials design model with components that are simple enough to design yet powerful enough to capture complex materials properties: rigid bodies composed of spherical particles with directional interactions (patchy particles). We showcase the method with self-assembly designs ranging from open lattices to self-limiting clusters, all of which are notoriously challenging design goals to achieve using purely isotropic particles. By directly optimizing over the location and interaction of the patches on patchy particles using gradient descent, we dramatically reduce the computation time for finding the optimal building blocks.","2024-07-02","2025-08-27 18:33:06","2025-08-27 18:33:06","","e2311891121","","27","121","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38913891 PMCID: PMC11228463","","; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/TZHQ9BNG/King et al. - 2024 - Programming patchy particles for materials assembly design.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38913891","","automatic differentiation; programmable assembly; self-assembly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These modifications consist of an extension to 3D, the ability of tiles to form “flexible” bonds that allow bound tiles to rotate relative to each other, and allowing tiles of multiple shapes within the same system. We call this new model the STAM*, and we present a series of constructions within it that are capable of self-replicating behavior. Namely, the input seed assemblies to our STAM* systems can encode either “genomes” specifying the instructions for building a target shape, or can be copies of the target shape with instructions built in. A universal tile set exists for any target shape (at scale factor 2), and from a genome assembly creates infinite copies of the genome as well as the target shape. An input target structure, on the other hand, can be “deconstructed” by the universal tile set to form a genome encoding it, which will then replicate and also initiate the growth of copies of assemblies of the target shape. Since the lengths of the genomes for these constructions are proportional to the number of points in the target shape, we also present a replicator which utilizes hierarchical self-assembly to greatly reduce the size of the genomes required. The main goals of this work are to examine minimal requirements of self-assembling systems capable of self-replicating behavior, with the aim of better understanding self-replication in nature as well as understanding the complexity of mimicking it.","2024-09-01","2025-08-27 18:43:12","2025-08-27 18:43:12","2025-08-27 18:43:12","497-530","","3","23","","Nat Comput","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/FR2BMMDQ/Alseth et al. - 2024 - Self-replication via tile self-assembly.pdf","","","Self-assembly; Self-replication; Signal-passing tiles; Tile Assembly Model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we propose a model for DNA origami that strikes a balance between these two criteria by representing these systems on a lattice at the level of binding domains. The free energy of hybridization between individual binding domains is estimated with a nearest-neighbour model. Double helical segments are treated as rigid rods, but we allow flexibility at points where the backbone of one of the strands is interrupted, which provides a reasonably realistic representation of partially and fully assembled states. Particular attention is paid to the constraints imposed by the double helical twist, as they determine where strand crossovers between adjacent helices can occur. To improve the efficiency of sampling configuration space, we develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling scaffold conformations in near-assembled states, and we carry out simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, enabling us to avoid considering states with unbound staples. We demonstrate that our model can quickly sample assembled configurations of a small origami design previously studied with the oxDNA model, as well as a design with staples that span longer segments of the scaffold. The sampling ability of our method should allow for good statistics to be obtained when studying the assembly pathways, and is suited to investigating in particular the effects of design and assembly conditions on these pathways and their resulting final assembled structures.","2018-12-21","2025-08-27 18:44:38","2025-08-27 18:44:38","2025-08-27 18:44:38","234905","","23","149","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1810.09356 [cond-mat]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/VF3IA9BH/Cumberworth et al. - 2018 - Lattice models and Monte Carlo methods for simulating DNA origami self-assembly.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/LZ5X4N34/1810.html","","","Condensed Matter - Soft Condensed Matter; Quantitative Biology - Biomolecules","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the theoretical core of this research is the Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), the original abstract model of DNA tile self-assembly. Recent advancements in DNA nanotechnology have been made in developing strand displacement mechanisms that could allow DNA tiles to modify themselves during the assembly process by opening or closing certain binding sites, introducing new dynamics into tile self-assembly. We focus on one way of incorporating such signaling mechanisms for binding site activation and deactivation into the theoretical model of tile self-assembly by extending the aTAM to create the Active aTAM. We give appropriate definitions first for incorporating activation signals and then for incorporating deactivation signals and tile detachment into the aTAM. We then give a comparison of Active aTAM to related models, such as the STAM, and take a look at some theoretical results. The goal of the work presented here is to define and demonstrate the power of the Active aTAM with and without deactivation. To this end, we provide four constructions of temperature 1 (also known as ""non-cooperative"") active tile assembly systems that can simulate other computational systems. The first construction concerns the simulation of an arbitrary temperature 2 (also known as ""cooperative"") standard aTAM system in the sense of producing equivalent structures with a scaling factor of 2 in each dimension; the second construction generates the time history of a given 1D cellular automaton. The third and fourth constructions make use of tile detachment in order to dynamically simulate arbitrary 1D and 2D cellular automata with assemblies that record only the current state updates and not the entire computational history of the specified automaton.","2015","2025-08-27 19:10:07","2025-08-27 19:10:07","2025-08-27 19:10:07","","101","","","","","","","","","","University of South Florida","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321684803","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/QGKXXZAC/Karpenko - 2015 - Active Tile Self-assembly and Simulations of Computational Systems.pdf","","","Active atam; Applied sciences; Cellular automata; Computer science; Dna self-assembly; Dna tiling; Pure sciences; Simulation; Temperature 1 assembly; Theoretical mathematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We call a TAS whose maximal assemblies contain at least one ultimately periodic assembly path {\it para-periodic}. We observe that a confluent 1-TAS has at most one maximal producible assembly, $\alpha_{max}$, that can be considered a union of path assemblies, and we show that such a system is always para-periodic. This result is obtained through a superposition and a combination of two paths that produce a new path with desired properties, a technique that we call \emph{co-grow} of two paths. Moreover we provide a characterization of an $\alpha_{max}$ of a confluent 1-TAS as one of two possible cases, so called, a grid or a disjoint union of combs. To a given $\alpha_{max}$ we can associate a finite labeled graph, called \emph{quipu}, such that the union of all labels of paths in the quipu equals $\alpha_{max}$, therefore giving a finite description for $\alpha_{max}$. This finite description implies that $\alpha_{max}$ is a union of semi-affine subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and since such a finite description can be algorithmicly generated from any 1-TAS, 1-TAS cannot have universal computational power.","2019-01-24","2025-08-27 19:11:06","2025-08-27 19:11:06","2025-08-27 19:11:06","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1901.08575 [cs]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/UF4GCSCS/Durand-Lose et al. - 2019 - Deterministic 2-Dimensional Temperature-1 Tile Assembly Systems Cannot Compute.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/BSDQ7428/1901.html","","","Computer Science - Computational Complexity; Computer Science - Computational Geometry; Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1901.08575","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-assembly has been widely observed in nature, ranging from the field of crystallography to the study of viruses and multicellular organisms. A natural question is whether a model of self-assembly can capture the hierarchical growth seen in nature or in other fields of mathematics. In this work, we consider hierarchical growth in substitution rules; informally, a substitution rule describes the iterated process by which the polygons of a given set are individually enlarged and dissected. We develop the Polygonal Two-Handed Assembly Model (p-2HAM) where building blocks, or tiles, are polygons and growth occurs when tiles bind to one another via matching, complementary bonds on adjacent sides; the resulting assemblies can then be used to construct new, larger structures. The p-2HAM is based on a handful of well-studied models, notably the Two-Handed Assembly Model and the polygonal free-body Tile Assembly Model. The primary focus of our work is to provide conditions which are either necessary or sufficient for the ``bordered simulation'' substitution rules. By this, we mean that a border made up of tiles is allowed to form around an assembly which then coordinates how the assembly interacts with other assemblies. In our main result, we provide a construction which gives a sufficient condition for bordered simulation. This condition is presented in graph theoretic terms and considers the adjacency of the polygons in the tilings associated to a given substitution rule. Alongside our results, we consider a collection of over one hundred substitution rules from various sources. We show that only the substitution rules in this collection which satisfy our sufficient condition admit bordered simulation. We conclude by considering open questions related to simulating substitution rules and to hierarchical growth in general.","2019","2025-08-27 19:11:42","2025-08-27 19:11:42","2025-08-27 19:11:42","","131","","","","","","","","","","University of South Florida","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781085621168","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/VP4E83K5/Cruz - 2019 - Hierarchical Self-assembly and Substitution Rules.pdf","","","Algorithmic self-assembly; Backtrack constructible; Backtrack paths; Hierarchical growth simulation; Mathematics; Tile assembly models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by applications in DNA-nanotechnology, investigations in algorithmic tile-based self-assembly have blossomed into a mature theory with research leveraging tools from computability theory, complexity theory, information theory, and graph theory to develop a wide range of models and show that many are computationally universal, while also exposing powers and limitations of each. Beyond computational universality, the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) was shown to be intrinsically universal (IU), a strong notion of completeness where a single tile set is capable of simulating all systems within the model; however, this result required non-deterministic tile attachments. This was later confirmed necessary when it was shown that the class of directed aTAM systems is not IU. Building on these results to further investigate the impacts of other dynamics, Hader et al. examined several tile-assembly models which varied across (1) the numbers of dimensions used, (2) restrictions based on diffusion of tiles through space, and (3) whether each system is directed, and showed which models are IU. Such results have shed much light on the roles of various aspects of the dynamics of tile-assembly and their effects on the intrinsic universality of each model. Here we provide direct comparisons of the various models by considering intrinsic simulations between models. We show that in some cases one model is more powerful than another, and in others, pairs of models have mutually exclusive capabilities. This comparison helps to expose the impacts of these three important aspects and further helps define a hierarchy of tile-assembly models.","2023-05-04","2025-08-27 19:14:11","2025-08-27 19:14:11","2025-08-27 19:14:11","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2305.01877 [cs]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/DUPT6847/Hader and Patitz - 2023 - The Impacts of Dimensionality, Diffusion, and Directedness on Intrinsic Cross-Model Simulation in Ti.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/9QZPA36J/2305.html","","","Computer Science - Computational Geometry; Computer Science - Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2305.01877","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
