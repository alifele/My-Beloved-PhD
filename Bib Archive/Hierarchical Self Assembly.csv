To exploit the potential benefits of structures with such “addressable complexity,” we need to understand the factors that optimize the yield and the kinetics of self-assembly. Here we use a simple theoretical method to explain the key features responsible for the unexpected success of DNA-brick experiments, which are currently the only demonstration of reliable self-assembly with such a large number of components. Simulations confirm that our theory accurately predicts the narrow temperature window in which error-free assembly can occur. Even more strikingly, our theory predicts that correct assembly of the complete structure may require a time-dependent experimental protocol. Furthermore, we predict that low coordination numbers result in nonclassical nucleation behavior, which we find to be essential for achieving optimal nucleation kinetics under mild growth conditions. We also show that, rather surprisingly, the use of heterogeneous bond energies improves the nucleation kinetics and in fact appears to be necessary for assembling certain intricate 3D structures. This observation makes it possible to sculpt nucleation pathways by tuning the distribution of interaction strengths. These insights not only suggest how to improve the design of structures based on DNA bricks, but also point the way toward the creation of a much wider class of chemical or colloidal structures with addressable complexity.","2015-05-19","2025-07-22 23:47:31","2025-07-22 23:47:31","2025-07-22 23:47:31","6313-6318","","20","112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pnas.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/D7TBK9V2/Jacobs et al. - 2015 - Rational design of self-assembly pathways for complex multicomponent structures.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specificity between components may arise from a wide variety of physical and chemical mechanisms in diverse contexts, from DNA hybridization to shape-sensitive depletion interactions. Despite this diversity, all systems that rely on interaction specificity operate under the constraint that increasing the number of distinct components inevitably increases off-target binding. Here we introduce “capacity,” the maximal information encodable using specific interactions, to compare specificity across diverse experimental systems and to compute how specificity changes with physical parameters. Using this framework, we find that “shape” coding of interactions has higher capacity than chemical (“color”) coding because the strength of off-target binding is strongly sublinear in binding-site size for shapes while being linear for colors. We also find that different specificity mechanisms, such as shape and color, can be combined in a synergistic manner, giving a capacity greater than the sum of the parts.","2016-05-24","2025-07-23 00:06:48","2025-07-23 00:06:48","2025-07-23 00:06:48","5841-5846","","21","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pnas.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/AVPMBV84/Huntley et al. - 2016 - Information capacity of specific interactions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main difference between them is that the two-dimensional ground state can be easily achieved by simple dynamical processes while in three dimensions, this is impossible due to the difference in the local and global optimal packings. In this paper we show experimentally and numerically that in 2 + ε dimensions, realized by a container which is in one dimension slightly wider than the spheres, the particles organize themselves in a triangular lattice, while touching either the front or rear side of the container. If these positions are denoted by up and down the packing problem can be mapped to a 1/2 spin system. At first it looks frustrated with spin-glass like configurations, but the system has a well defined ground state built up from isosceles triangles. When the system is agitated, it evolves very slowly towards the potential energy minimum through metastable states.

In his early studies of reversible computation, Bennett imagined an enzymatic Turing Machine which modiﬁed a hetero-polymer (such as DNA) to perform computation with asymptotically low energy expenditures. Adleman’s recent experimental demonstration of a DNA computation, using an entirely different approach, has led to a wealth of ideas for how to build DNA-based computers in the laboratory, whose energy efﬁciency, information density, and parallelism may have potential to surpass conventional electronic computers for some purposes. In this thesis, I examine one mechanism used in all designs for DNA-based computer –the self-assembly of DNA by hybridization and formation of the double helix – and show that this mechanism alone in theory can perform universal computation. To do so, I borrow an important result in the mathematical theory of tiling: Wang showed how jigsaw-shaped tiles can be designed to simulate the operation of any Turing Machine. I propose constructing molecular Wang tiles using the branched DNA constructions of Seeman, thereby producing self-assembled and algorithmically patterned two-dimensional lattices of DNA. Simulations of plausible self-assembly kinetics suggest that low error rates can be obtained near the melting temperature of the lattice; under these conditions, self-assembly is performing reversible computation with asymptotically low energy expenditures. Thus encouraged, I have begun an experimental investigation of algorithmic self-assembly. A competition experiment suggests that an individual logical step can proceed correctly by self-assembly, while a companion experiment demonstrates that unpatterned two dimensional lattices of DNA will self-assemble and can be visualized. We have reason to hope, therefore, that this experimental system will prove fruitful for investigating issues in the physics of computation by self-assembly. It may also lead to interesting new materials.","2006-05","2025-08-18 21:57:22","2025-08-18 21:57:22","2025-08-18 21:57:22","4-4","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Okinawa","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/4W5Y4C5K/Winfree - 2006 - Algorithmic Self-Assembly of DNA.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006 International Conference on Microtechnologies in Medicine and Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by ‘top-down’ methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide ‘staple strands’ to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).","2006-03","2025-08-22 18:14:23","2025-08-22 18:14:23","2025-08-22 18:14:23","297-302","","7082","440","","","","","","","","","","en","2006 Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/VV6MAS4J/Rothemund - 2006 - Folding DNA to create nanoscale shapes and patterns.pdf","","","Humanities and Social Sciences; multidisciplinary; Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, abstract tiles were translated into DNA tiles based on double-crossover motifs. Serving as input for the computation, long single-stranded DNA molecules were used to nucleate growth of tiles into algorithmic crystals. For both of two independent molecular realizations, atomic force microscopy revealed recognizable Sierpinski triangles containing 100–200 correct tiles. Error rates during assembly appear to range from 1% to 10%. Although imperfect, the growth of Sierpinski triangles demonstrates all the necessary mechanisms for the molecular implementation of arbitrary cellular automata.

However, even incremental steps toward designing functional materials have proven challenging. If the material is constructed from highly complex components, the design space of materials properties rapidly becomes too computationally expensive to search. On the other hand, very simple components such as uniform spherical particles are not powerful enough to capture rich functional behavior. Here, we introduce a differentiable materials design model with components that are simple enough to design yet powerful enough to capture complex materials properties: rigid bodies composed of spherical particles with directional interactions (patchy particles). We showcase the method with self-assembly designs ranging from open lattices to self-limiting clusters, all of which are notoriously challenging design goals to achieve using purely isotropic particles. By directly optimizing over the location and interaction of the patches on patchy particles using gradient descent, we dramatically reduce the computation time for finding the optimal building blocks.","2024-07-02","2025-08-27 18:33:06","2025-08-27 18:33:06","","e2311891121","","27","121","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38913891 PMCID: PMC11228463","","; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/TZHQ9BNG/King et al. - 2024 - Programming patchy particles for materials assembly design.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38913891","","automatic differentiation; programmable assembly; self-assembly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We call this new model the STAM*, and we present a series of constructions within it that are capable of self-replicating behavior. Namely, the input seed assemblies to our STAM* systems can encode either “genomes” specifying the instructions for building a target shape, or can be copies of the target shape with instructions built in. A universal tile set exists for any target shape (at scale factor 2), and from a genome assembly creates infinite copies of the genome as well as the target shape. An input target structure, on the other hand, can be “deconstructed” by the universal tile set to form a genome encoding it, which will then replicate and also initiate the growth of copies of assemblies of the target shape. Since the lengths of the genomes for these constructions are proportional to the number of points in the target shape, we also present a replicator which utilizes hierarchical self-assembly to greatly reduce the size of the genomes required.

Here, we propose a model for DNA origami that strikes a balance between these two criteria by representing these systems on a lattice at the level of binding domains. The free energy of hybridization between individual binding domains is estimated with a nearest-neighbour model. Double helical segments are treated as rigid rods, but we allow flexibility at points where the backbone of one of the strands is interrupted, which provides a reasonably realistic representation of partially and fully assembled states. Particular attention is paid to the constraints imposed by the double helical twist, as they determine where strand crossovers between adjacent helices can occur. To improve the efficiency of sampling configuration space, we develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling scaffold conformations in near-assembled states, and we carry out simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, enabling us to avoid considering states with unbound staples. We demonstrate that our model can quickly sample assembled configurations of a small origami design previously studied with the oxDNA model, as well as a design with staples that span longer segments of the scaffold. The sampling ability of our method should allow for good statistics to be obtained when studying the assembly pathways, and is suited to investigating in particular the effects of design and assembly conditions on these pathways and their resulting final assembled structures.","2018-12-21","2025-08-27 18:44:38","2025-08-27 18:44:38","2025-08-27 18:44:38","234905","","23","149","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1810.09356 [cond-mat]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/VF3IA9BH/Cumberworth et al. - 2018 - Lattice models and Monte Carlo methods for simulating DNA origami self-assembly.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/LZ5X4N34/1810.html","","","Condensed Matter - Soft Condensed Matter; Quantitative Biology - Biomolecules","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the theoretical core of this research is the Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), the original abstract model of DNA tile self-assembly. Recent advancements in DNA nanotechnology have been made in developing strand displacement mechanisms that could allow DNA tiles to modify themselves during the assembly process by opening or closing certain binding sites, introducing new dynamics into tile self-assembly. We focus on one way of incorporating such signaling mechanisms for binding site activation and deactivation into the theoretical model of tile self-assembly by extending the aTAM to create the Active aTAM. We give appropriate definitions first for incorporating activation signals and then for incorporating deactivation signals and tile detachment into the aTAM. We then give a comparison of Active aTAM to related models, such as the STAM, and take a look at some theoretical results. The goal of the work presented here is to define and demonstrate the power of the Active aTAM with and without deactivation. To this end, we provide four constructions of temperature 1 (also known as ""non-cooperative"") active tile assembly systems that can simulate other computational systems. The first construction concerns the simulation of an arbitrary temperature 2 (also known as ""cooperative"") standard aTAM system in the sense of producing equivalent structures with a scaling factor of 2 in each dimension; the second construction generates the time history of a given 1D cellular automaton. The third and fourth constructions make use of tile detachment in order to dynamically simulate arbitrary 1D and 2D cellular automata with assemblies that record only the current state updates and not the entire computational history of the specified automaton.","2015","2025-08-27 19:10:07","2025-08-27 19:10:07","2025-08-27 19:10:07","","101","","","","","","","","","","University of South Florida","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781321684803","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/QGKXXZAC/Karpenko - 2015 - Active Tile Self-assembly and Simulations of Computational Systems.pdf","","","Active atam; Applied sciences; Cellular automata; Computer science; Dna self-assembly; Dna tiling; Pure sciences; Simulation; Temperature 1 assembly; Theoretical mathematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We call a TAS whose maximal assemblies contain at least one ultimately periodic assembly path {\it para-periodic}. We observe that a confluent 1-TAS has at most one maximal producible assembly, $\alpha_{max}$, that can be considered a union of path assemblies, and we show that such a system is always para-periodic. This result is obtained through a superposition and a combination of two paths that produce a new path with desired properties, a technique that we call \emph{co-grow} of two paths. Moreover we provide a characterization of an $\alpha_{max}$ of a confluent 1-TAS as one of two possible cases, so called, a grid or a disjoint union of combs. To a given $\alpha_{max}$ we can associate a finite labeled graph, called \emph{quipu}, such that the union of all labels of paths in the quipu equals $\alpha_{max}$, therefore giving a finite description for $\alpha_{max}$. This finite description implies that $\alpha_{max}$ is a union of semi-affine subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and since such a finite description can be algorithmicly generated from any 1-TAS, 1-TAS cannot have universal computational power.","2019-01-24","2025-08-27 19:11:06","2025-08-27 19:11:06","2025-08-27 19:11:06","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1901.08575 [cs]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/UF4GCSCS/Durand-Lose et al. - 2019 - Deterministic 2-Dimensional Temperature-1 Tile Assembly Systems Cannot Compute.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/BSDQ7428/1901.html","","","Computer Science - Computational Complexity; Computer Science - Computational Geometry; Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1901.08575","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-assembly has been widely observed in nature, ranging from the field of crystallography to the study of viruses and multicellular organisms. A natural question is whether a model of self-assembly can capture the hierarchical growth seen in nature or in other fields of mathematics. In this work, we consider hierarchical growth in substitution rules; informally, a substitution rule describes the iterated process by which the polygons of a given set are individually enlarged and dissected. We develop the Polygonal Two-Handed Assembly Model (p-2HAM) where building blocks, or tiles, are polygons and growth occurs when tiles bind to one another via matching, complementary bonds on adjacent sides; the resulting assemblies can then be used to construct new, larger structures. The p-2HAM is based on a handful of well-studied models, notably the Two-Handed Assembly Model and the polygonal free-body Tile Assembly Model. The primary focus of our work is to provide conditions which are either necessary or sufficient for the ``bordered simulation'' substitution rules. By this, we mean that a border made up of tiles is allowed to form around an assembly which then coordinates how the assembly interacts with other assemblies. In our main result, we provide a construction which gives a sufficient condition for bordered simulation. This condition is presented in graph theoretic terms and considers the adjacency of the polygons in the tilings associated to a given substitution rule. Alongside our results, we consider a collection of over one hundred substitution rules from various sources. We show that only the substitution rules in this collection which satisfy our sufficient condition admit bordered simulation. We conclude by considering open questions related to simulating substitution rules and to hierarchical growth in general.","2019","2025-08-27 19:11:42","2025-08-27 19:11:42","2025-08-27 19:11:42","","131","","","","","","","","","","University of South Florida","United States -- Florida","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781085621168","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/VP4E83K5/Cruz - 2019 - Hierarchical Self-assembly and Substitution Rules.pdf","","","Algorithmic self-assembly; Backtrack constructible; Backtrack paths; Hierarchical growth simulation; Mathematics; Tile assembly models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by applications in DNA-nanotechnology, investigations in algorithmic tile-based self-assembly have blossomed into a mature theory with research leveraging tools from computability theory, complexity theory, information theory, and graph theory to develop a wide range of models and show that many are computationally universal, while also exposing powers and limitations of each. Beyond computational universality, the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) was shown to be intrinsically universal (IU), a strong notion of completeness where a single tile set is capable of simulating all systems within the model; however, this result required non-deterministic tile attachments. This was later confirmed necessary when it was shown that the class of directed aTAM systems is not IU. Building on these results to further investigate the impacts of other dynamics, Hader et al. examined several tile-assembly models which varied across (1) the numbers of dimensions used, (2) restrictions based on diffusion of tiles through space, and (3) whether each system is directed, and showed which models are IU. Such results have shed much light on the roles of various aspects of the dynamics of tile-assembly and their effects on the intrinsic universality of each model. Here we provide direct comparisons of the various models by considering intrinsic simulations between models. We show that in some cases one model is more powerful than another, and in others, pairs of models have mutually exclusive capabilities. This comparison helps to expose the impacts of these three important aspects and further helps define a hierarchy of tile-assembly models.","2023-05-04","2025-08-27 19:14:11","2025-08-27 19:14:11","2025-08-27 19:14:11","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2305.01877 [cs]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/DUPT6847/Hader and Patitz - 2023 - The Impacts of Dimensionality, Diffusion, and Directedness on Intrinsic Cross-Model Simulation in Ti.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/9QZPA36J/2305.html","","","Computer Science - Computational Geometry; Computer Science - Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2305.01877","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Principles governing protein-protein interactions have long been known. However, principles by which such nanoscale interactions generate diverse phenotypes of mesoscale assemblies, including phase-separated compartments, remains challenging to characterize and understand. To illuminate such principles, we create a system of two proteins designed to interact and form mesh-like assemblies in living cells. We devise a novel strategy to map high-resolution phase diagrams in vivo, which provide mesoscale self-assembly signatures of our system. The structural modularity of the two protein components allows straightforward modification of their molecular properties, enabling us to characterize how point mutations that change their interaction affinity impact the phase diagram and material state of the assemblies in vivo. Both, the phase diagrams and their dependence on interaction affinity were captured by theory and simulations, including out-of-equilibrium effects seen in growing cells. Applying our system to interrogate biological mechanisms of self-assembly, we find that co-translational protein binding suffices to recruit an mRNA to the designed micron-scale structures.","","2025-08-28 17:47:24","2025-08-28 17:47:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/85ECPCVC/Heidenreich et al. - Designer protein assemblies with tunable phase diagrams in living cells.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To develop information-based chemistry as a technology for programming matter to function in ways not seen in biological systems, it is necessary to understand how molecular interactions can encode and execute algorithms. The self-assembly of relatively simple units into complex products is particularly well suited for such investigations. Theory that combines mathematical tiling and statistical–mechanical models of molecular crystallization has shown that algorithmic behaviour can be embedded within molecular self-assembly processes, and this has been experimentally demonstrated using DNA nanotechnology with up to 22 tile types. However, many information technologies exhibit a complexity threshold—such as the minimum transistor count needed for a general-purpose computer—beyond which the power of a reprogrammable system increases qualitatively, and it has been unclear whether the biophysics of DNA self-assembly allows that threshold to be exceeded. Here we report the design and experimental validation of a DNA tile set that contains 355 single-stranded tiles and can, through simple tile selection, be reprogrammed to implement a wide variety of 6-bit algorithms. We use this set to construct 21 circuits that execute algorithms including copying, sorting, recognizing palindromes and multiples of 3, random walking, obtaining an unbiased choice from a biased random source, electing a leader, simulating cellular automata, generating deterministic and randomized patterns, and counting to 63, with an overall per-tile error rate of less than 1 in 3,000. These findings suggest that molecular self-assembly could be a reliable algorithmic component within programmable chemical systems. The development of molecular machines that are reprogrammable—at a high level of abstraction and thus without requiring knowledge of the underlying physics—will establish a creative space in which molecular programmers can flourish.","2019-03-20","2025-08-28 17:50:03","2025-08-28 17:50:03","","366-372","","7748","567","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1038/s41586-019-1014-9 MAG ID: 2924487690","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By combining temperature-dependent dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy with coarse-grained simulations, we show how subtle changes in the nucleation pathway profoundly affect the yield of the correctly formed structures. In particular, we can increase the range of conditions over which self-assembly occurs by using stable multisubunit clusters that lower the nucleation barrier for assembling subunits in the interior of the structure. Consequently, modifying only a small portion of a structure is sufficient to optimize its assembly. Due to the generality of our coarse-grained model and the excellent agreement that we find with our experimental results, the design principles reported here are likely to apply generically to addressable, multicomponent self-assembly.","2018-06-11","2025-08-28 17:50:15","2025-08-28 17:50:15","","201806010","","26","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1806010115 MAG ID: 2775031315 PMID: 29891671","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a system with exactly one copy of each staple strand, we observe a complete assembly pathway in an intermediate temperature window; at low temperatures successful assembly is prevented by misbonding while at higher temperature the free-energy barriers to assembly become too large for assembly on our simulation time scales.

Upon translational diffusion mediated collisions, c-ssDNAs interpenetrate each other to form correct (cc), incorrect (icc), and trap correct contacts (tcc) inside the reaction volume. Correct contacts are those with exact registry matches, which leads to nucleation and zipping. Incorrect contacts are the mismatch contacts which are less stable compared to tcc, which can occur in the repetitive c-ssDNAs. Although tcc possess registry match within the repeating sequences, they are incorrect contacts in the view of the whole c-ssDNAs. The nucleation rate (𝑘𝑁) is directly proportional to the collision rate and the average number of correct contacts (⟨𝑛𝑐⁢𝑐⟩) formed when both c-ssDNAs interpenetrate each other. Detailed lattice model simulations suggest that ⟨𝑛𝑐⁢𝑐⟩∝𝐿/𝑉 where 𝐿 is the length of c-ssDNAs and 𝑉 is the reaction volume. Further numerical analysis revealed the scaling for the average radius of gyration of c-ssDNAs (𝑅𝑔) with their length as 𝑅𝑔∝√𝐿. Since the reaction space will be approximately a sphere with radius equals to 2⁢𝑅𝑔 and 𝑉∝𝐿3/2, one obtains 𝑘𝑁∝1√𝐿. When c-ssDNAs are nonrepetitive, the overall renaturation rate becomes as 𝑘𝑅∝𝑘𝑁⁢𝐿, and one finally obtains 𝑘𝑅∝√𝐿 in line with the experimental observations. When c-ssDNAs are repetitive with a complexity of 𝑐, earlier models suggested the scaling 𝑘𝑅∝√𝐿𝑐, which breaks down at 𝑐=𝐿. This clearly suggests the existence of at least two different pathways of renaturation in the case of repetitive c-ssDNAs, viz., via incorrect contacts and trap correct contacts. The trap correct contacts can lead to the formation of partial duplexes which can keep the complementary strands in the close proximity for a prolonged timescale. This is essential for the extended 1D slithering, inchworm movements, and internal displacement mechanisms which can accelerate the searching for the correct contacts. Clearly, the extent of slithering dynamics will be inversely proportional to the complexity. When the complexity is close to the length of c-ssDNAs, the pathway via incorrect contacts will dominate. When the complexity is much less than the length of c-ssDNA, pathway via trap correct contacts would be the dominating one.","2022-06-21","2025-08-28 17:59:55","2025-08-28 17:59:55","2025-08-28 17:59:55","064410","","6","105","","Phys.

In contrast to DNA origami, the DNA brick method permits a variety of different structures to be realized using the same library of DNA strands. As a consequence of their design, however, assembled DNA brick structures have fewer interhelical connections in comparison to equivalent DNA origami structures. Although the overall shape of the DNA brick objects has been characterized and found to conform to the features of the target designs, the microscopic properties of DNA brick objects remain yet to be determined. Here, we use the all-atom molecular dynamics method to directly compare the structure, mechanical properties and ionic conductivity of DNA brick and DNA origami structures different only by internal connectivity of their consistituent DNA strands. In comparison to equivalent DNA origami structures, the DNA brick structures are found to be less rigid and less dense and have a larger cross-section area normal to the DNA helix direction. At the microscopic level, the junction in the DNA brick structures are found to be right-handed, similar to the structure of individual Holliday junctions (HJ) in solution, which contrasts with the left-handed structure of HJ in DNA origami. Subject to external electric field, a DNA brick plate is more leaky to ions than an equivalent DNA origami plate because of its lower density and larger cross-section area. Overall, our results indicate that the structures produced by the DNA brick method are fairly similar in their overall appearance to those created by the DNA origami method but are more compliant when subject to external forces, which likely is a consequence of their single crossover design.","2016-05","2025-08-28 18:02:12","2025-08-28 18:02:12","2025-08-28 18:02:12","055012","","5","18","","New J.

Guided by atomic-resolution models, we develop fusions of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain or a phosphorylatable SH2-binding peptide, respectively, to two symmetric, homo-oligomeric proteins. Mixing the two designed components resulted in a variety of dendritic, hyperbranched and sponge-like topologies that are phosphorylation-dependent and self-similar over three decades (~10 nm–10 μm) of length scale, in agreement with models from multiscale computational simulations.

One of our constructions shows that specializing the notion of a quine, a program which prints its own output, to the language of tile-assembly naturally induces a fractal structure. The other construction introduces self-describing circuits as a means to abstractly represent the information flow through a tile-assembly construction and shows that such circuits may be constructed for a relative of the Sierpinski carpet, and indeed many other DSSFs, through a process of fixed-point iteration. This later result, or more specifically the machinery used in its construction, further enable us to provide a polynomial time procedure for deciding whether any given subset of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ will generate an aTAM producible DSSF.

Meanwhile, with high-speed operating efficiency and sustainable operation, DNA walkers powered by strand displacement reaction or protein enzyme/DNAzyme reaction, have highly sensitive detection and signal amplification abilities, which are applied in biosensing, material assembly and synthesis, and early cancer diagnosis. Worthily, DNA walkers could be regarded as signal amplifiers, which enhanced the signal transduction and amplified biosensor sensing signals.

The archetypal network-style diagrammatic language is that of electric circuits; other examples include signal flow graphs, Markov processes, automata, Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key feature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with multiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that may then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network. The components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in this language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by introducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic languages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic interpretation gives a hypergraph functor. The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories. In particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations. Decorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories from diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are modelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components themselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through decorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that permits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors. These are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic languages and functors from diagrams to the semantics. To illustrate these principles, the second part of this thesis details applications to linear time-invariant dynamical systems and passive linear networks.","2016-09-17","2025-08-29 15:39:33","2025-08-29 15:39:33","2025-08-29 15:39:33","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1609.05382 [math]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/VDHEL8FD/Fong - 2016 - The Algebra of Open and Interconnected Systems.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/D8I9GVUV/1609.html","","","Mathematics - Category Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1609.05382","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been suggested that intricate self-assembly processes will ultimately be used in circuit fabrication, nano-robotics, DNA computation, and amorphous computing. In this paper, we study two combinatorial optimization problems related to eﬃcient self-assembly of shapes in the Tile Assembly Model of self-assembly proposed by Rothemund and Winfree [18]. The ﬁrst is the Minimum Tile Set Problem, where the goal is to ﬁnd the smallest tile system that uniquely produces a given shape. The second is the Tile Concentrations Problem, where the goal is to decide on the relative concentrations of diﬀerent types of tiles so that a tile system assembles as quickly as possible. The ﬁrst problem is akin to ﬁnding optimum program size, and the second to ﬁnding optimum running time for a “program” to assemble the shape.","","2025-08-29 16:39:42","2025-08-29 16:39:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/P6BZM9X5/Adleman - Combinatorial Optimization Problems in Self-Assembly.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-assembly can achieve this task efficiently, but may be subject to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations: Reactants, intermediates and products may collide with each other throughout the assembly timecourse to produce non-target instead of target species. An alternative approach to nanoscale assembly uses information-containing molecules such as DNA to control interactions and thereby minimize unwanted crosstalk between different components. In principle, this method should allow the stepwise and programmed construction of target products by fastening individually selected nanoscale components – much as an automobile is built on an assembly line. Here, we demonstrate that a nanoscale assembly line can indeed be realized by the judicious combination of three known DNA-based modules: a DNA origami tile that provides a framework and track for the assembly process, cassettes containing three distinct two-state DNA machines that serve as programmable cargo-donating devices, and are attached, in series to the tile, and a DNA walker that can move on the track from device to device and collect cargo. As the walker traverses the pathway prescribed by the origami tile track, it encounters sequentially the three DNA devices that can be independently switched between an ‘ON’ state allowing its cargo to be transferred to the walker, and an ‘OFF’ state where no transfer occurs. We use three different types of gold nanoparticles as cargo and show that the experimental system does indeed allow the controlled fabrication of the eight different products that can be obtained with three two-state devices.","2010-05-13","2025-08-29 17:01:28","2025-08-29 17:01:28","2025-08-29 17:01:28","202-205","","7295","465","","Nature","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20463734 PMCID: PMC2872101","","","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2872101/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the completeness of transcriptional networks for digital logic is well-established, *analog* computation plays a crucial role in biological systems and offers significant potential for synthetic biology applications. While transcriptional circuits typically rely on cooperativity and highly non-linear behavior of transcription factors to regulate *production* of proteins, they are often modeled with simple linear *degradation* terms. In contrast, general analog dynamics require both non-linear positive as well as negative terms, seemingly necessitating control over not just transcriptional (i.e., production) regulation but also the degradation rates of transcription factors. Surprisingly, we prove that controlling transcription factor production (i.e., transcription rate) without explicitly controlling degradation is mathematically complete for analog computation, achieving equivalent capabilities to systems where both production and degradation are programmable. We demonstrate our approach on several examples including oscillatory and chaotic dynamics, analog sorting, memory, PID controller, and analog extremum seeking. Our result provides a systematic methodology for engineering novel analog dynamics using synthetic transcriptional networks without the added complexity of degradation control and informs our understanding of the capabilities of natural transcriptional circuits. We provide a compiler, in the form of a Python package that can take any system of polynomial ODEs and convert it to an equivalent transcriptional network implementing the system *exactly*, under appropriate conditions.","2025-08-19","2025-08-29 17:08:58","2025-08-29 17:08:58","2025-08-29 17:08:58","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2508.14017 [cs]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/C7IZ3VAA/Doty et al. - 2025 - Analog computation with transcriptional networks.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/UGBCTDYE/2508.html","","","Computer Science - Computational Complexity; Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Computer Science - Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2508.14017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has also become of increasing practical importance over the last half-century as the energetic cost of digital devices has exploded. Importantly, real-world computers obey multiple physical constraints on how they work, which affects their thermodynamic properties. Moreover, many of these constraints apply to both naturally occurring computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, and digital systems. Most obviously, all such systems must finish their computation quickly, using as few degrees of freedom as possible. This means that they operate far from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, many computers, both digital and biological, are modular, hierarchical systems with strong constraints on the connectivity among their subsystems. Yet another example is that to simplify their design, digital computers are required to be periodic processes governed by a global clock. None of these constraints were considered in 20th-century analyses of the thermodynamics of computation. The new field of stochastic thermodynamics provides formal tools for analyzing systems subject to all of these constraints. We argue here that these tools may help us understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental thermodynamic properties of physical systems are related to the computation they perform.","2024-11-05","2025-08-29 17:10:00","2025-08-29 17:10:00","2025-08-29 17:10:00","e2321112121","","45","121","","Proc.

In order to bind, two assemblies must have matching glues that can simultaneously touch each other, and stick together with strength that is at least the temperature $$\tau $$ , where $$\tau $$ is some fixed positive integer. We ask whether the 2HAM is intrinsically universal.

We show that for all $$\tau ' &lt; \tau $$ &lt; , each temperature-$$\tau '$$ 2HAM tile system does not simulate at least one temperature-$$\tau $$ 2HAM tile system. This impossibility result proves that the 2HAM is not intrinsically universal and stands in contrast to the fact that the (single-tile addition) abstract Tile Assembly Model is intrinsically universal. On the positive side, we prove that, for every fixed temperature $$\tau \ge 2$$ 2, temperature-$$\tau $$ 2HAM tile systems are indeed intrinsically universal. In other words, for each $$\tau $$ there is a single intrinsically universal 2HAM tile set $$U_{\tau }$$U that, when appropriately initialized, is capable of simulating the behavior of any temperature-$$\tau $$ 2HAM tile system. As a corollary, we find an infinite set of infinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing simulation power within each hierarchy.

In general, self-assembly constructs complex (polyomino-shaped) structures from a limited set of square tiles. Previous work by Demaine et al. considered a setting in which assembly proceeds in stages. It was shown that a relatively small number of tile types suﬃces to produce arbitrary shapes; however, these constructions were only based on a spanning tree of the geometric shape, so they did not produce full connectivity of the underlying grid graph.

Current software for materials engineering allows the user to specify polypeptide chains and simple secondary structures prior to molecular dynamics simulation, but is not flexible in terms of the geometric arrangement of unequilibrated structures. Given some knowledge of a larger-scale structure, instructing the software to create it can be very difficult and time-intensive. To this end, the present paper reports a mathematical language, using category theory, to describe the architecture of a material, i.e., its set of building blocks and instructions for combining them. While this framework applies to any hierarchical material, here we concentrate on proteins. We implement this mathematical language as an open-source Python library called Matriarch. It is a domain-specific language that gives the user the ability to create almost arbitrary structures with arbitrary amino acid sequences and, from them, generate Protein Data Bank (PDB) files. In this way, Matriarch is more powerful than commercial software now available.

"LVXD6ALG","journalArticle","","Janssens, Dirk","Assemblies as Graph Processes","","","","","","This short paper explores the potential of embedding-based graph rewriting as a tool for understanding natural computing, and in particular self-assembly. The basic point of view is that aggregation steps in self-assembly can be adequately described by graph rewriting steps in an embedding-based graph transformation system: the building blocks of an assembly correspond to occurrences of rewriting rules, and hence assemblies correspond to graph processes. However, meaningful algorithms do not consist only of aggregation steps, but also of global steps in which assemblies are modiﬁed. A theoretical algorithm is presented in which the two kinds of steps are combined: on the one hand aggregation steps that build assemblies, and on the other hand global steps which act on the assemblies.","","2025-08-29 17:31:28","2025-08-29 17:31:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/7GN74BDE/Janssens - Assemblies as Graph Processes.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We define a generalization of the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), such that a tile system consists of a collection of polyomino tiles, the Polyomino Tile Assembly Model (polyTAM), and investigate the computational powers of polyTAM systems at temperature 1, where attachment among tiles occurs without glue cooperation. Systems composed of the unit-square tiles of the aTAM at temperature 1 are believed to be incapable of Turing universal computation (while cooperative systems, with temperature > 1, are able). As our main result, we prove that for any polyomino $P$ of size 3 or greater, there exists a temperature-1 polyTAM system containing only shape-$P$ tiles that is computationally universal. Our proof leverages the geometric properties of these larger (relative to the aTAM) tiles and their abilities to effectively utilize geometric blocking of particular growth paths of assemblies, while allowing others to complete. To round out our main result, we provide strong evidence that size-1 (i.e. aTAM tiles) and size-2 polyomino systems are unlikely to be computationally universal by showing that such systems are incapable of geometric bit-reading, which is a technique common to all currently known temperature-1 computationally universal systems. We further show that larger polyominoes with a limited number of binding positions are unlikely to be computationally universal, as they are only as powerful as temperature-1 aTAM systems. Finally, we connect our work with other work on domino self-assembly to show that temperature-1 assembly with at least 2 distinct shapes, regardless of the shapes or their sizes, allows for universal computation.","2014-08-18","2025-08-29 17:33:17","2025-08-29 17:33:17","2025-08-29 17:33:17","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1408.3351 [cs]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/48HP2HPT/Fekete et al. - 2014 - Universal Computation with Arbitrary Polyomino Tiles in Non-Cooperative Self-Assembly.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/2C6SC84W/1408.html","","","Computer Science - Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1408.3351","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our primary biological example is the self-assembly of icosahedral viruses; our synthetic example is surface-tension-driven self-folding polyhedra. In both instances, the process of self-assembly is modeled by decomposing the polyhedron into a set of partially formed intermediate states. The set of all intermediates is called the configuration space, pathways of assembly are modeled as paths in the configuration space, and the kinetics and yield of assembly are modeled by rate equations, Markov chains, or cost functions on the configuration space. We review an interesting interplay between biological function and mathematical structure in viruses in light of this framework. We discuss in particular: (i) tiling theory as a coarsegrained description of all-atom models; (ii) the building game—a growth model for the formation of polyhedra; and (iii) the application of these models to the self-assembly of the bacteriophage MS2. We then use a similar framework to model self-folding polyhedra. We use a discrete folding algorithm to compute a configuration space that idealizes surface-tension-driven self-folding and analyze pathways of assembly and dominant intermediates. These computations are then compared with experimental observations of a self-folding dodecahedron with side 300 Am. In both models, despite a combinatorial explosion in the size of the configuration space, a few pathways and intermediates dominate self-assembly. For self-folding polyhedra, the dominant intermediates have fewer degrees of freedom than comparable intermediates, and are thus more rigid. The concentration of assembly pathways on a few intermediates with distinguished geometric properties is biologically and physically important, and suggests deeper mathematical structure.","2014-10","2025-08-29 17:34:14","2025-08-29 17:34:14","2025-08-29 17:34:14","409-439","","4","20","","Artificial Life","Building Polyhedra by Self-Assembly","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/VN5R9CKA/Kaplan et al. - 2014 - Building Polyhedra by Self-Assembly Theory and Experiment.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reaction kinetics can be modeled as an elementary step continuous-time Markov chain, where states correspond to secondary structures and transitions correspond to base pair formation and breakage. Since the number of states in the Markov chain could be large, rates are determined by estimating the mean first passage time from sampled trajectories. As a result, the cost of kinetic predictions becomes prohibitively expensive for rare events with extremely long trajectories. Also problematic are scenarios where multiple predictions are needed for the same reaction, e.g., under different environmental conditions, or when calibrating model parameters, because a new set of trajectories is needed multiple times. We propose a new method, called pathway elaboration, to handle these scenarios. Pathway elaboration builds a truncated continuous-time Markov chain through both biased and unbiased sampling. The resulting Markov chain has moderate state space size, so matrix methods can efficiently compute reaction rates, even for rare events. Also the transition rates of the truncated Markov chain can easily be adapted when model or environmental parameters are perturbed, making model calibration feasible. We illustrate the utility of pathway elaboration on toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions, show that it well-approximates trajectory-based predictions of unbiased elementary step models on a wide range of reaction types for which such predictions are feasible, and demonstrate that it performs better than alternative truncation-based approaches that are applicable for mean first passage time estimation. Finally, in a small study, we use pathway elaboration to optimize the Metropolis kinetic model of Multistrand, an elementary step simulator, showing that the optimized parameters greatly improve reaction rate predictions.

The bonds are flexible, so that the assembly can bind on the edges of the polycube. We are interested in the study of SFTAM self-assemblies on 3D surfaces which are not always embeddable in the Euclidean plane, in order to compare their different behaviors and to compute the topological properties of the host surfaces. We focus on a family of polycubes called cuboids. Order-0 cuboids are polycubes that have six rectangular faces, and order-1 cuboids are made from two order-0 cuboids by substracting one from the other. Thus, order-1 cuboids can be of genus 0 or of genus 1 (then they contain a tunnel). We are interested in the genus of these structures, and we present a SFTAM tile assembly system that determines the genus of a given order-1 cuboid. The SFTAM tile assembly system which we design, contains a specific set $Y$ of tile types with the following properties. If the assembly is made on a host order-1 cuboid $C$ of genus 0, no tile of $Y$ appears in any producible assembly, but if $C$ has genus 1, every terminal assembly contains at least one tile of $Y$. Thus, we are able to distinguish the host surfaces according to their genus, by the tiles used in the assembly. This system is specific to order-1 cuboids but the techniques we use should be generalizable to other families of shapes.","2023-06-15","2025-08-29 18:06:27","2025-08-29 18:06:27","2025-08-29 18:06:27","","","","","","","DNA tile self-assembly for 3D-surfaces","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2210.13094 [cs]","","/home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/G4YSQHSZ/Becker and Heydarshahi - 2023 - DNA tile self-assembly for 3D-surfaces Towards genus identification.pdf; /home/alifeleparanj/Zotero/storage/V7TWPIMF/2210.html","","","Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2210.13094","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet recent advances suggest otherwise: addressable structures with hundreds of distinct building blocks have been designed and assembled with nanometer precision. Despite this remarkable success, it is often challenging to optimize a self-assembly reaction to ensure that the intended structure is kinetically accessible.
