	* very similar research to mine: Research in our group is interdisciplinary, on the border between theoretical physics and chemistry, applied mathematics and biology. We apply theoretical and computational tools from statistical mechanics to study how complex behaviour emerges from the interaction of many individual objects. We are particularly interested in biological physics and the dynamics of soft-matter.

	* He is working on the experimental self assembly: Patchy-particle self-assembly. The group has been at the forefront of exploring how colloidal particles with directional interactions could be used to assemble a wide variety of structure, be they crystals, high smmetry clusters or, most recently, quasicrystals. In particularly, we have recently discovered how to design such "patchy particles" to assemble into icosahedral quasicrystals. We plan to extend this approach to quasicrystals with other symmetries, including symmetries never previously observed in materials, and are exploring ways to realize these patchy particles using DNA origami with experimental collaborators.
