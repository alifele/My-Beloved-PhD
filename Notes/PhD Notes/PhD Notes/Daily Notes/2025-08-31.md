# Shift spaces and tiling

Consider the space $\ell_2(-\infty,\infty)$, the space of bi-infinite sequences that are square sumable. Let $S_l: \ell_2 \to \ell_2$ denote the shift operator that shifts every element in the sequence one position to the left. $S_l^n$ is defined as $n$-times consecutive application of $S_l$. Consider the subspace 
$$ \{ \left(\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_nS_l^n\right)x\ |\ x\in \ell_2, \alpha_n\in F \}, $$
where $F$ is the underlying field of the vector space. Recall that $\ell_2$ is isomorphic to $Z$ that is the linear space of all complex-valued functions $f(z)$ defined on the unit circle of the complex plane such that
$$ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int |f(z)|^2 \frac{dz}{z} < \infty. $$
The isomorphism is given as
$$ \ell_2 \ni \xi \mapsto \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \xi_n z^{-n}. $$
Observe that the operator $\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_nS_l^n$ is the same as multiplication by $\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n z^{-n}$. For more see Example 4 on page 175 of the linear operator theory textbook.

The construction above is the well-known Z-transform that turns the problem of the discretely sampled signals to working with Polynomials in $z$ and $1/z$ on complex plane and the poles and zeros of these polynomials have many information about the filters made from these components shift and multiply and sum components. 

I am thinking about a similar thing in self assembly and the tiling problem. Is it any way to convert problems in this domain to problems in other domains where one can utilize analytic tools. For instance, how one can construct a linear space structure on the tile spaces and define appropriate tiling operators and show that these operators are similar to other operators in other isomorphic space (like the shift operators vs. multiplication by polynomials).

second #idea 
Let's consider the set of all 2D tiles over the final alphabet $\Sigma$. The set of all such possible tilings is 
$$ \Sigma^{\mathbb{Z}^2}, $$
which is the same as the set of all functions from $\mathbb{Z}^2$ to $\Sigma$. 

First, observe that since the alphabet is finite, assuming that it has $N$ elements, then one can write $[n] = \{1,2,3,\cdots,n\}$ in place of $\Sigma$. As far as the set structure of $\Sigma$ is considered, it is fine to do so. However, seeing these two spaces as topological spaces, one automatically assumes a discrete topology over the set $\Sigma$, however, in the case of $[n]$ one automatically assumes that 2 is "close" to 1 and 3 and far from $n$. So we might exploit this topological property of the alphabet set in deciding which tilling is plausible and which is not: based on their gluing structure, that a tile of certain type is willing to be close to the tiles of other type. Then one can possibly encode the plausible tiles as functions that are continuous given the topology of their domain $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and their range $\Sigma$. 


#idea 
I am also thinking about some form of generalized Fourier transform, where the certain favorable glue-glue interaction on a particular edge shows up as a special form of frequency component of the assembly. Then the problem of valid assemblies will be the set of structure that can contain some kind of certain frequency components.
