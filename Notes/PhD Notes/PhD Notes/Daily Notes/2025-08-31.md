# Shift spaces and tiling

Consider the space $\ell_2(-\infty,\infty)$, the space of bi-infinite sequences that are square sumable. Let $S_l: \ell_2 \to \ell_2$ denote the shift operator that shifts every element in the sequence one position to the left. $S_l^n$ is defined as $n$-times consecutive application of $S_l$. Consider the subspace 
$$ \{ \left(\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_nS_l^n\right)x\ |\ x\in \ell_2, \alpha_n\in F \}, $$
where $F$ is the underlying field of the vector space. Recall that $\ell_2$ is isomorphic to $Z$ that is the linear space of all complex-valued functions $f(z)$ defined on the unit circle of the complex plane such that
$$ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int |f(z)|^2 \frac{dz}{z} < \infty. $$
The isomorphism is given as
$$ \ell_2 \ni \xi \mapsto \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \xi_n z^{-n}. $$
Observe that the operator $\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_nS_l^n$ is the same as multiplication by $\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n z^{-n}$. For more see Example 4 on page 175 of the linear operator theory textbook.

The construction above is the well-known Z-transform that turns the problem of the discretely sampled signals to working with Polynomials in $z$ and $1/z$ on complex plane and the poles and zeros of these polynomials have many information about the filters made from these components shift and multiply and sum components. 

I am thinking about a similar thing in self assembly and the tiling problem. Is it any way to convert problems in this domain to problems in other domains where one can utilize analytic tools. For instance, how one can construct a linear space structure on the tile spaces and define appropriate tiling operators and show that these operators are similar to other operators in other isomorphic space (like the shift operators vs. multiplication by polynomials).
