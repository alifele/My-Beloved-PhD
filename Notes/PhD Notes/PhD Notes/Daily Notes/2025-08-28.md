#history Supramolecular chemistry starting from ~1960 - 1980 was the starting point of understanding self assembly, like the crown ether discovered by Pedersen. Jean-Marie Lehn, Donald Cram, and Pedersen where main figures --> First understanding of [molecular self assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_self-assembly#:~:text=through%20non,assembly.%5B%2010). There are two types of molecular self-assembly: Intermolecular, and intramolecular (which is also called folding).



#history Around 1980 By Seeman, and Drexler, the molecular nanotechnology and DNA nanotechnology emerged.

#history "Engines of creation" by Dexler (with a foreword  by Marvin Minskey) published in 1986. It builds on the ideas discussed by Feynmann in his 1959 talk. The book "Nano systems" in 1992 is more technical material of the same topic. This lead to Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexler%E2%80%93Smalley_debate_on_molecular_nanotechnology))

#TODO Find a copy of Nanosystems(1992) by Dexler to study the main ideas.

#TODO #history A historical note about Seeman with his own words [link](https://history.amercrystalassn.org/h-seeman#:~:text=junctions,than%20using%20trial%20and%20error). 

#history Eric Baum first mentioned the idea of DNA memory in 1995 [link](https://history.amercrystalassn.org/h-seeman#:~:text=junctions,than%20using%20trial%20and%20error). 

#idea Although the self assembly proved to be Turning complete (1998 by Winfree), but any meaningful construction of complex structures would require error control mechanisms in the fabrication. The hierarchical self assembly, can provide a practical way for error control by assembling the structure in different stages.

#TODO Read more on this: Subsequent theoretical work in the 2000s addressed these issues, devising **error-correction schemes** (e.g. “proofreading tiles” to reduce assembly errors) and studying the **computational complexity** of self-assembly. Results showed that assembling certain shapes is NP-hard and that there are trade-offs between the number of tile types, assembly speed, and error rates – linking algorithmic self-assembly to complexity theory and probability theory (for analysis of error probabilities).

#TODO Review this Wikipedia article about the self-assembly of nano-particles that contains lots of ideas from thermodynamics: [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-assembly_of_nanoparticles#:~:text=The%20self,lowest%20energy%20configuration%20is%20found).

#history The first DNA origamy by Paul was in 2006: [link](https://thisis.caltech.edu/news/worlds-smallest-mona-lisa-80563#:~:text=To%20make%20a%20single%20square,seen%20using%20atomic%20force%20microscopy), [link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09449-cover51#:~:text=Scientists%20smiled%20with%20DNA%20origami,predetermined%20shape%20of%20double)

#history after 2006's Pauls's first smiley with self assembly, researchers demonstrated 3d self assemblies with DNA origami in 2006-2009. Then by Peng Yin’s group in 2012 they introduced the idea of DNA bricks, making the construction much more simpler.
