[[Erik Winfree]] in his thesis cites [Molecular Computation of Solutions to Combinatorial Problems](https://ubc.summon.serialssolutions.com/2.0.0/link/0/eLvHCXMwfV3NS8MwFH_ohqAH0alYp7NHPXQuTT8WmMoURZGB6O4lSZOLuk47D_73vqRpUWGe89qUvK-85uX3A6BhfxD8iQlCpiHPzZEZ45jjBE1M17vleeCh0smfVp1JfTXGdFnWIdLG7byQ5pf5WUioYVpK48v5e2A4pMxZa02owR3RQn5ODBzYKrQjY7wtaF89PI-floLyOuifH5dq-ilLaRKTX1mralw0XZS8xIXUFQPG8i2qTVW3W7Dp9pj-uDKKbVhRsw6sVayTXx3YmDRQrWUHtp13l_6Jg6A-3YH70Rv_eLmY1Ny5vrTkD1aLfqH9xmD9RWHGsLw2xTvasu8YasrRmX3FLkxvb6bXd4EjXQhkxNJFwKOcpoNcR0zoYaxFLLkmSaiZ1uj6KhEhE5JK9FaFpR5VkeADTTCmxlIxXKw9aM2KmdoHHxMdU3lKJMnzCIVQJuJUMqEEVknDyIN-vaaZdIDkhhfjNbOFSZhkTgmZU4IHJ80D8wqLY7norlVSIxcOh1ibMQ-OfimtGUeDpFibetCtlZg5Zy6zxtY8OG5G0QvN0QqfqeKzzIjZ5hDGlktgWUdT3E16sFfZRjO1--SDf6fuwrpFcTYNiOQQWouPT3VkkSJ60B5Prx-fe866e7at9RsGlwvm "Molecular Computation of Solutions to Combinatorial Problems"). This paper itself cites Feynman and his talk in 1959 about the idea of building microscopic computers. The following is a direct quote from [him](https://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~thlin/Feynman_1959.pdf)


> [!quote] There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom
> I would like to describe a field, in which little has been done, but in which an enormous amount can be done in principle. This field is not quite the same as the others in that it will not tell us much of fundamental physics (in the sense of, "What are the strange particles?") but it is more like solid-state physics in the sense that it might tell us much of great interest about the strange phenomena that occur in complex situations. Furthermore, a point that is most important is that it would have an enormous number of technical applications. What I want to talk about is the problem of manipulating and controlling things on a small scale.

> But it is interesting that it would be, in principle, possible (I think) for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down. Give the orders and the physicist synthesizes it. How? Put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance. The problems of chemistry and biology can be greatly helped if our ability to see what we are doing, and to do things on an atomic level, is ultimately developed—a development which I think cannot be avoided.
