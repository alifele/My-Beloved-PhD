#idea Recently, I was thinking about Turing completeness of reaction diffusion systems, after studying Turing completeness of Wang tiling systems and Hierarchical self assembly. A quick search revealed that the reaction diffusion systems are Turing complete. So it leaves me with this question that how the reaction diffusion systems at all related to Hierarchical self assembly? Can any of them capture some properties of the other one, etc?
