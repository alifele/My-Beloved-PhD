* Recently, I was thinking about Turing completeness of reaction diffusion systems, after studying Turing completeness of Wang tiling systems and Hierarchical self assembly. A quick search revealed that the reaction diffusion systems are Turing complete. So it leaves me with this question that how the reaction diffusion systems at all related to Hierarchical self assembly? Can any of them capture some properties of the other one, etc?
* Reaction diffusion (RD) are also capable of capturing more interesting stuff since they are not energetically favorable states (as they are in the case of tile self assembly). Chemical reactions supply energy to the system and the diffusion and degradation- dissipates it. 
* The evolving vector fields (like the gradient of species) can spatialy difrect the tiles and the evolving patterns can be used for staged assembly (think of the peaks and valleys of the reactions as the traps for certain tiles that does chemo-taxis in response to certain chemicals that has their peak concentration there). RD systems enables the control of assembly in space and time.
* Larger scale species, does assembly following these gradients. So reaction diffusion systems might be a possible way to direct the assembly of smaller scale modules to create bigger scale ones --> So it will be very important to design tiles that can sense and respond to the gradient of the chemicals of some sort.
