Things to study more:
* Algorithmic information theory
	* Kolmogorov complexity
	* Chomsky hierarchy: I always think about how to encode the structure of some desired assembly system into some grammer in a language and that the problem of the hierarchical self assembly becomes the problem of finding some automaton that recognizes that language.
	* Somewhere in Paul's thesis I read: For example, the self-assembly of DNA strucutures may be mapped naturally onto the languages of the Chomsky Hierarchy: linear DNA self-assembly is equivalent to the regular languages, assembly of DNA dendrimers (trees) is equivalent to the context-free languages, and assembly of four-connected DNA lattices is equivalent to unrestricted grammars.
	* I found following important #paper [Universal Computation via Self-assembly of DNA](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/Papers/self-assem.pdf). This paper discusses the relation of the languages with the self-assembly of the DNA structure.
	* #idea Context free languages can generate nested structures (like well-defined formulas $(x+y)*z$) which corresponds to some expression tree). The context-free languages can be determined by non-deterministic push-down automaton.
	* #idea Given a set of molecular building blocks and rules for their self-assembly, is it possible to write a computer program (like a finite automata) to decide (accept) such a structure (that signals the feasibility of the assembly)
