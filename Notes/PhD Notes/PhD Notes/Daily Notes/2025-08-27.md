#history
* Feynman's talk in 1959 about the feasibility of nano fabrication and nano computers
* DNA nano technology emerging from the works of Seeman (~1980)
* Aldeman working on the non-conventional computing using DNA (~1994)
* Winfree's series of papers followed by his thesis (1995-1998) making much of the stuff rigorous in the field
	* Focusing on the computational power of assemblies, etc
* Paul Rutherfond's thesis 2001 
* Winfree - Paul paper (~2004) ([link](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020424&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) for providing making the first Serpinskely triangle using DNA self assembly. #idea How the works by Mathav Murugan that works on the heat kernel on the fractal structures can shed some lights on useful meta material applications of these DNA tiles. #idea . There are also other Fractal self assemblies in recent papers [link](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611978322.80)


* #TODO Stochastic landscape model: A recent paper (2024) [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37403408/) that has a very similar approach to the one by Miranda's group.
* #TODO Important recent paper about teh applications of DNA origami [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36990451/)
* #TODO Interesting assemblies of different structure, including Monaliza, etc
* #TODO #Important Relatively new #thesis building on top of Winfree's approach [link](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154471012.pdf).
* #TODO #Important Another new #thesis on Hierarchical self assembly [link](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2284217248?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses)
* #TODO short and interesting paper on theory of algorithmic self assembly [link](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/Papers/algorithmic_tiles2012doty.pdf).
