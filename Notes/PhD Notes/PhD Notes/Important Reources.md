* A non-trivial problem first solved by DNA computing by Aldeman group: Solution of a 20-variable 3-SAT problem on a DNA computer
* Ruthermound Phd Thesis: [link](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/Papers/pwkr_thesis_nov15.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (interestingly he talks about Anne Condon in his thesis introduction!)
	* He uses some of the TAM work from Winfree's model. 
	* He constructs a binary counter 
* George M. Whitesides 
	* Paul in his thesis mentions him that falls under the umberla of more libareal usage of the notion of self assembly in the foot note.
