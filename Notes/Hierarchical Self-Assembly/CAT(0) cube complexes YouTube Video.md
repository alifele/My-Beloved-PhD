Several applications require a data structure to represent the subdivision of an object --> combinatorial map



People:
[Lukas Nabergall](https://nabergall.com/#): I found him via his thesis when studying the combinatoric of the chord diagrams. Then I read on his website: *My interests revolve around thermodynamic computing, open-endedness, and artificial intelligence. I want to create open-ended systems that persistently produce interesting, useful things, including intelligence. I currently believe that harnessing the natural tendency of matter to self-organize and evolve under thermodynamic influences is the best path to creating such systems.* ---> Very interesting stuff. My first time seeing the concepts like open-ended systems, etc


Some good illustrations for the Catlan numbers:https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~schaeffe/Master/Catalan.pdf
Combinatorial maps and compact data structures:  https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~schaeffe/Master/LecNotes-2006.pdf


Compact data structures --> data structures that the amount of space to store them is close to the information theoretical limit, while allowing for reasonable query times.
