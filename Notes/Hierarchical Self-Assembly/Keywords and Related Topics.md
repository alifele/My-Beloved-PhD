Addressable structures

#### Addressable Structures and DNA Origami

There are a lot of interesting papers in this context. There even some papers that are describing how to some specific structures that can lead to interaction of these origami with other parts of the system [@knappeFunctionalizingDNAOrigami2023]


### Nucleation barrier:
Assembling a complex, addressable structure (like a DNA brick nano structure) requires overcoming a sizable free-energy barrier during nucleation.
**Nucleation**: Spontaneous formation of new thermodynamic phase, starting from a state of meta stability. The kinetics of formation of the new phase is frequently dominated by nucleation, such that the time to nucleate determines how long it will take for the new phase to appear. 
*Personal thoughts: For the time scale of the nucleation has some similarities to the time scale of a Markov chain to visit some states*.

In [@jacobsRationalDesignSelfassembly2015], they talk about the fact that  robust assembly us only possible within a narrow temperature window where nucleation is slow enough to avoid many competing seeds. 
--> Personal Thought: This idea of the temperature window, for my is very similar to the idea of the analog radio frequency synthesizers, that they in fact have not builtin oscillators. They only structure that they have is just an amplifies, that amplifies one specific frequency, and because in the thermal noise in the environment there are frequencies of all scales, it can pick up and amplify the frequency of interest from the room temperature fluctuations. 



#### Relations to Graph Theory
The topology of the interaction network in the target structure determines the free energy landscape. The connectivity graph of the designed structure dictates the critical nucleus size and barrier height.



[@jacobsCommunicationTheoreticalPrediction2015] : They treated the assembly as a statistical ensemble of all possible partial structures ("fragments") and computed a kind of density of states for fragments of different sizes. This measure theoretic approach, essentially counting and weighting every assembly pathway, allowed them to calculate equilibrium yields and nucleation rates in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations
*Personal thoughts: The fact that there is a free energy landscape for the hierarchical self assembly, gives the power to use the differential geometry concepts. Ans also studying different stochastic processes on the manifolds, can be an interesting way to study some structures given their free energy landscape*
--> Having a distribution of interaction energies - rather than all bonds equal - was predicted to improve the nucleation kinetics and yield for certain intricate structures. 


#### Relation to Information Theory
[@huntleyInformationCapacitySpecific2016] (and summarized in a journal club document under the same name in Zotero) quantify the maximum information encodable in a set of specific interactions. In systems like lock-and-key binding (or DNA complementary binding), as the number of distinc pairs incrases, the potential for crosstalk errors grows. They found that shape complementarity (local and keys that can physically fit together) can achieve a higher capacity (more distinict pairs) than purely chemelical binding specificity. Such results ite statistical physics to measure theory and information thoery, treating binding configurations as probability distributions and using entropy measures to assess specificaity.  




#### Why the hierarchical self assembly is important for me?
There are numerouse instances in the life that one tends to argue about some facts (like politics, society, or any other structure that is many body in nature) in the similar way tshat they have arguments about non-many body systems. Because they think that the behaviour of a collection is the same as the sum of the behaviour of its sum. But we have learned just recently (in the developments related to the developmenet of the complex systems) we learnt that this is by no ways true. Collection can exhibit behaviours that is no way even close to the behaviour of the individuals, as the systems in the classical thermodynamics and statistical physics exhibit. These many body forces are REALLY forces in action (like the pressure, that is just a collective behaviour of the gas atoms in the sample). These collective behaviour really have potentials (Helmholtz, etc) and really excert forces (entropic forces). Exactly like the other classical physical forces. To demonstrate this force, I usually collect the feather of some birds on the street that exhibit nice patters. Observing these strcutures close enought, one can see that how enigneerd structures are these feathers (light weight, with sophisticated hallow middle structure etc) and really apprecaites the forces in the nature that caused this kind of evolutions. But if one pay closer attention, then they will see the entropic forces in action!!! The forces that forced the feather to evolve to exhibit some patterns (that do not help to float in the sky, but helps them in other context, like mating, camoflage, etc). So by looking at a feather closely, one can easily see these entropic forces in action that are as important as the factors that they feather needs to have to overcome to the "calssic" gravitiy forces, but these forces helps them to overcome some other forces that are excerted by the manybody systems that they are living it (these are not random patterns at all, as a random pattern is pure noise!). 

The thing about hierarcichal self assembly that really makes my happy that I love it a lot, is the fact that hierarchical self assembly now allows for buliding strucutres by using the entropic and many body forces. So these forces, not only they exist, but also you can do engineering with them. And this brings a very interesting combination of engineering, mathematics, physics, biology, and computations. The toplics that I have been trying to learn and master over the years, and now I have all of them in one packages. Also the observations are so general that one can easily see these things in social contexts, cosmological structures, and basically any many body system. I am so happy that I have a chance to work on this problem, having two great supervisors to help me.
